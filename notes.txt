THE COBORDISM HYPOTHESIS
DAVID AYALA & JOHN FRANCIS
The cobordism hypothesis for topological quantum field theories is an analogue
of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms for homology: the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms state that a homology theory is uniquely determined by its value on a point; the cobordism hypothesis states that
a topological quantum field theory is uniquely determined by its value on a point.

"Origin of the tail in Green’s functions in odd dimensional space-times"
De-Chang Dai1 and Dejan Stojkovic2
    While studying the propagation of light in ether,
    around 1690, Huygens concluded that perturbations produced by
    by a light source placed at (r = 0, t = 0) propagate
    away in the form of spherical waves with uniform velocity.
    Every spatial point reached by the wave front behaves as
    a new source and produces a new spherical wave. As a
    result, an entire envelope of the spherical waves in space
    is formed [1]. This is the historic idea of the Huygens’
    principle, which proved very useful in our studies of wave
    propagation phenomena and interference (including the
    famous double slit experiment).
    Then, around 1900, Hadamard came to conclusion that
    the Huygens’ principle in odd-dimensional space-times
    is violated [2].

Group theory is a language of *ambiguity*, just like
probability theory. Probabilities already live in a vector
space, and so I think this is why vector spaces show
up so effectively in studying groups. Eg., the group
algebra "unifies" these two viewpoints.

    strong subadditivity is the statement that given any
    probability distribution on three variables, A, B, C,
    a certain combination of entropies of non-negative: SAB+SBC−SB−SABC≥0
    S_{AB}+S_{BC}-S_B-S_{ABC}\geq 0. It is trivial to prove
    this inequality classically (repeated application of
    the chain rule) and yet for quantum states it is a very
    difficult theorem that was first proven by Lieb and Ruskai.
    Since then, multiple other proofs for quantum systems
    have been found, yet there still is none that is really
    elementary. So, even a new proof of that would be of
    interest, as well as understanding the various inequalities
    that might hold on four-or-more variable systems.

    I like to think of a matrix algebra Mn(C) M_n(\mathbb{C})
    as the groupoid algebra of the groupoid on n n objects
    in which any two objects are isomorphic via a unique isomorphism. 

Young diagrams classify finite-dimensional C*-algebras:
     if every finite-dimensional C*-algebra is isomorphic
    to a finite direct sum of matrix algebras, and each finite-dimensional
    matrix algebra is of the form Mn(C) M_n(\mathbb{C}),
    then each could be associated to a multiset of positive integers.

        of convex algebras consisting of only the finite sets
    the category of finitely generated free convex algebras
    the category of simplices and convex-combination-preserving maps.

Beyond the Shannon-Khinchin Formulation: The Composability
Axiom and the Universal Group Entropy
Piergiulio Tempesta
    the notion of entropy is intimately related with group theory. 
    Indeed, admissible entropies
    have associated a formal group law, controlling crucially their properties.
    ...
    Another important aspect that deserves to be clarified
    is the possible numbertheoretical content of the notion
    of universal group entropy. In [45], a connection between
    a set of entropic functionals and a class of Dirichlet series has been
    established. It has been proved that the formal group exponentials defining a
    specific family of entropies can be used to define L-functions.
    The most paradigmatic case is offered by Tsallis entropy,
    directly related to the Riemann zeta
    function. A construction of universal congruences and generalized Bernoulli
    polynomials connected with formal groups has been provided in [46] and in [43].

More Secrets of the Associahedra
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2018/01/more_secrets_of_the_associahed.html
take a formal power series like this:
C(x)=x+c1x2+c2x3+⋯
C(x) = x + c_1 x^2 + c_2 x^3 + \cdots
If you take its right inverse under composition, meaning the power series D D with
C(D(x))=x
C(D(x)) = x
you get another formal power series of the same type:
D(x)=x+d1x2+d2x3+⋯
D(x) = x + d_1 x^2 + d_2 x^3 + \cdots
How are the dn d_n related to the cn c_n?
What are these coefficients? They’re controlled by the associahedra!

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/formal+group
Any power series of the form f(x)=x+a2x2+a3x3+… 
f(x) = x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \ldots in R[[x]] R[ [x] ] 
has a functional or compositional inverse f−1(x) f^{-1}(x) 
in the monoid xR[[x]] x R[ [x] ] under composition. 
Thus we may define a 1-dimensional formal group law 
by the formula μ(x,y)=f−1(f(x)+f(y)) \mu(x, y) = f^{-1}(f(x) + f(y)).

Uncertainty from Heisenberg to Today
Reinhard F. Werner and Terry Farrelly
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06139.pdf
    uncertainty and statistics arise at “Heisenberg’s cut”,
    which separates the quantum object from the instruments used for
    observation.

    The semi-classical language contributes much to uncertainty
    about the question of what exactly the “Copenhagen interpretation”
    is. The name suggests that
    there should exist a manifesto from which one may learn
    this interpretation. But neither proponents nor opponents
    of the Copenhagen interpretation
    have ever found such a manifesto, which could count as the
    interpretation of the theory
    on the level of 1927 (the new quantum mechanics). Moreover,
    Heisenberg and Bohr were not of one mind on many important questions
    and also changed their minds over the course of time. The most plausible answer
    to the question “Who invented the Copenhagen Interpretation?” comes from Don
    Howard in an article with that title [24]. The answer is “Heisenberg
    in the 1950s”. Before that, there were hints of the “Copenhagen spirit” and of individual
    statements, but one cannot identify a distinct doctrine.

    6.1.8 Extended TQFTs
    We conjecture that the CTL framework is also capable
    of describing extended TQFTs [73]. Ordinary axiomatic
    TQFTs associate numbers to n-manifolds and vector spaces to (n − 1)-
    manifolds. A d-extended TQFT also associates (higher)
    categories to (n − 2)-manifolds (n − 3)-manifolds,.., (n − d)-
    manifolds.


The Ten-Fold Way (Part 1)
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2014/07/the_tenfold_way.html

    if you have an irreducible unitary representation of
    a group on a complex Hilbert space H H, there are three possibilities:
    The representation is isomorphic to its dual via an invariant
    symmetric bilinear pairing g:H×H→C g : H \times H \to
    \mathbb{C}. In this case it has an invariant antiunitary
    operator J:H→H J : H \to H with J2=1 J^2 = 1. This lets
    us write our representation as the complexification of a real one.
    
    The representation is isomorphic to its dual via an invariant
    antisymmetric bilinear pairing ω:H×H→C \omega : H \times
    H \to \mathbb{C}. In this case it has an invariant antiunitary
    operator J:H→H J : H \to H with J2=−1 J^2 = -1. This
    lets us promote our representation to a quaternionic one.
    
    The representation is not isomorphic to its dual. In
    this case we say it’s truly complex.

The Super Brauer Group and Super Division Algebras
Todd Trimble
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/trimble/superdivision.html
    Let V be the category of finite-dimensional super vector
    spaces over R.  By super algebra I mean a monoid in this
    category.  There's a bicategory whose objects are super
    algebras A, whose 1-cells  M: A --> B  are left A- right B-
    modules in V, and whose 2-cells are homomorphisms
    between modules.  This is a symmetric monoidal bicategory
    under the usual tensor product on V.

https://ncatlab.org/johnbaez/show/Schur+functors+II
    The ring of symmetric functions, commonly called Λ \Lambda,
    has a wealth of fascinating structure. It is not only
    a commutative ring, but also a ‘cocommutative coring’,
    and these structures are compatible in way that makes
    it into a ‘biring’. As noted by Tall and Wraith (ref),
    the category of birings has an interesting monoidal structure
    that makes Λ \Lambda into is a monoid object. Borger
    and Wieland have dubbed a monoid object in the category
    of birings a ‘plethory’.
    
    But what is Λ \Lambda, and why is it a plethory? While
    Λ \Lambda may be defined using generators and relations,
    a more elegant definition is also possible: it is the
    Grothendieck group of the category of ‘Schur functors’,
    which we denote by Schur Schur This fact not only allows
    us to efficiently obtain the plethory structure on Λ
    \Lambda, it allows us to ‘categorify’ all this structure:
    that is, to see it as present in the category Schur Schur.
    That is our aim here.

    Rule 1: When in doubt, start in the middle
    While text typically is quite linear when reading (although
    for reviewing a paper, for example, this might not be
    the best strategy, but I digress), there is no need for
    linearity when writing. More to the point, some people
    are actually scared of starting to write. The reason
    for this is the “fear of the empty page”, which I like
    to refer to as the horror vacui of writing.
    
    The best remedy, it seems, is to start with the parts
    that one deems to be easy. In a scientific paper, this
    could be the part containing details about your new method,
    for example. In a report, it could be a description of
    the results you achieved—and so on.
    
    I find that the hard part is starting the writing process,
    so if I start with something that I consider to be easy,
    the writing will be flowing better afterwards. As a short
    aside, this is why I typically write the outer parts
    of a scientific paper, i.e. conclusion, introduction,
    and related work, at the very end once everything else
    is in place already—and once I have achieved sufficient
    speed, or momentum, to actually tackle those sections.

Division by three
Peter G. Doyle, John Horton Conway
(Submitted on 31 May 2006)
    We prove without appeal to the Axiom of Choice that for
    any sets A and B, if there is a one-to-one correspondence
    between 3 cross A and 3 cross B then there is a one-to-one
    correspondence between A and B. The first such proof,
    due to Lindenbaum, was announced by Lindenbaum and Tarski
    in 1926, and subsequently `lost'; Tarski published an
    alternative proof in 1949. We argue that the proof presented
    here follows Lindenbaum's original.
Figure 11: Subtraction, illustrated in this figure, is as simple as following the
arrows. It’s really just 0-dimensional cobordism theory in disguise.

Division by four
Peter G. Doyle Cecil Qiu
    Write A  B if there is an injection from A to B, and A ≍ B if
    there is a bijection. We give a simple proof that for finite n, n × A
    n × B implies A  B. From the Cantor-Bernstein theorem it then
    follows that n × A ≍ n × B implies A ≍ B. These results have
    a long and tangled history, of which this paper is meant to be the
    culmination.

Producing New Bijections from Old

From numerical simulation it looks like the above system
of equations truncated to $n$ has kernel with dimension
equal to the number of prime factors in $n$. I'm guessing
this corresponds to the choice of value of $\log(p)$ for prime $p$.

Also, I finally found a proof that $W(3,1)\lt W(2,2).$ It uses the two equations
$$
\begin{array}{c}
W(2,1) + W(3,1) = W(1,1) + W(2,2) \\
W(6,2) + W(8,1) = W(2,1) + W(6,3).
\end{array}
$$

These simplify to
$$
\begin{array}{c}
W(2,1) + W(3,1) = 3W(1,1)\\
2W(3,1) + W(8,1) = 4W(2,1).
\end{array}
$$
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and then combining
with the second equation we get
$$
6W(3,1) + W(8,1) = 12W(1,1) = 6W(2,2)
$$
and because $W(a,b)\gt 0$ the result follows, as long
as we are willing to cancel the factor of 6.

All of this makes me think that entropy can be defined
taking values in a rig, or 2-rig, or traced monoidal
category, or some other gadget like that. Working just
over the natural numbers I would hope to see the "real"
entropy show up as a colimit, similar to how Paolo Perrone
explains 
<a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2019/03/the_kantorovich_monad.html">here</a> .

Agreeing to Disagree
Robert J. Aumann
The Annals of Statistics, Vol. 4, No. 6. (Nov., 1976), pp. 1236-1239.
http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4512.pdf

James:
    before we start i want to make a quick stab at writing
    down here my (delayed ...) immediate reactions to your
    suggestions about hopf algebras as unifying group theory
    and probability in some ways ....
    so my first reaction is to mention a couple of contrasting
    flavors of hopf algebras with potentially very contrasting
    geometric and/or conceptual interpretations ....  to
    begin with, there's commutative hopf algebras vs cocommutative
    ones .....  (and then there's also those that are both or neither ....
    more about those later i guess ....) so
    there's a pretty big contrast between the commutative
    ones and the cococmmutative ones ....
    the commutative ones generally have an interpretation
    as algebras of _functions_ on a group (with multiplication
    being pointwise and thus commutative) whereas the cocommutative
    ones generally have an interpretation as algebras of
    _measures_ on a group (with multiplication being convolution,
    which isn't commutative on a nonabelian group .... though
    the _co_multiplication ends up being cocommutative for
    some good reason) ....  so
    that strongly suggests to me that the hopf algebras you're
    interested in here are to begin with mainly the _co_commutative
    ones, because their elements are sensibly interpreted
    as measures (aka "unnormalized probability distributions")
    
    (i hope my writing instead of talking at the moment isn't
    too annoying ... it's helping me think a bit .... as
    i have something relatively "canned" to say, and not
    very deep or sustained, and it might help to have these
    comments saved in written form on the chatboard here ....)

    second : now that you mention it it seems like i _should_
    try to combine ideas about the probabilistic aspect of
    hecke operators and hecke algebras with ideas about the
    probabilistic aspect of cocomutative hopf algebras, but
    i probably haven't actually done that too much yet ....
    however there's one pretty simple idea along these lines
    probably worth mentioning here :
    some people think of hecke algebras as being certain
    sorts of subquotients of group algebras ....
    (i tend to associate this idea with vaughan jones of
    "jones knot polynomial" fame because that's probably
    where i learned the idea from, but the idea is probably
    pretty much older ....)
    (i hope that "subquotient" is the correct terminology
    and correct idea here, but i'm not going to worry about
    the details too much at the moment .... the rough idea
    is to think of the elements of a hecke algebra as _special_
    probability measures on a group g, that "respect" a subgroup
    h ..... or something like that; i'm being really sloppy
    here .... but i hope you can get a sense here of how
    there's a relationship to thinking of the elements of
    a cocommutative hopf algebra as probability measures on a group g ....)
    third:
    this is an attempt to respond more conceptually though
    also more vaguely to your general vague idea of relating
    "ambiguity" with ["probability" and/or "non-determinism"] ..... :
    there's a mathematician named (i think) persi diaconis
    whose work i'm vaguely familiar with though i never looked
    at in that much detail .... perhaps i should have looked
    at it more because it looked interesting .... and perhaps
    there might be a lot of other people working on similar ideas  ....
    i think i first heard of persi diaconis because they
    were one of those people that martin gardner used to
    talk about .... someone who was both a mathematician
    and a (?semi-pro) stage magician and so forth ....
    and i think they did some serious/ish work dealing with
    the probabilistic mathematics of card-shuffling, in connection
    with card-shuffling stage-magic tricks, but also dealing
    with it in a more serious way ....
    
    and i'm hoping that it's semi-obvious how this might
    connect to the ideas you're sort-of suggesting about
    hopf algebras and probability theory and so forth ....
    except that i  might not be doing a good job of conveying
    how this work might actually involve seriously inteesting
    ideas, even if i used the word "serious" several times ....
    so maybe i should stop right about here, in large part
    because i don't have very much more intelligent to say
    yet about the ideas here .... just that i think the ideas
    may be worth pursuing ....

    ...

    i mentioned how cocommutative measure hopf algebras seem
    more directly related to probability ideas than commutative
    function hopf algebras do, but there's all sorts of "duality"
    games that you can play here ....
    actually now i'm struggling to remember how probability-theorists
    exploit this kind of "fourier duality" .... i guess they
    talk about some sort of "characteristic function" and/or
    "generating function" of a probability distribution sometimes,
    meaning some kind of fourier-ish transform .....
    however there's another idea worth mentioning here, which
    again involves vaughan jones, and which might relate
    to fourier duality in some way, but which seems like
    an independent idea in its own right ....
    namely, just the still mysterious/ish (to me) ideas about
    how hopf algebras which are _neither_ commutative nor
    cocommutative may nevertheless exhibit a sort of "braiding"
    behavior, and this may not only give interesting knot
    invariants, but perhaps more interestingly relate to
    "quantum" ideas .... though as often happens you might
    have to be somewhat skeptical about how literally the
    adjective "quantum" should be interpreted in terminology
    such as "quantum group" ....
    
    i guess that i'm vaguely wondering here about whether
    the probabilistic / non-deterministic aspect of quantum
    physics could seriously relate to the algebra of [neither
    commutative nor cocommutative but "braided"] hopf algebras
    in some way .... again, vaguely inspired by your vague
    idea about hopf algebra and probability ....


https://mathoverflow.net/questions/64610/codes-lattices-vertex-operator-algebras
    If you have a code, there are methods to construct lattices
    using it, but some of the constructions (like the Leech
    lattice) require special properties of the code. If you
    have a lattice, there are methods to construct vertex
    operator algebras using it (e.g., the lattice VOA), but
    some of the constructions, like orbifolds, depend on
    properties of the lattice, like the existence of automorphisms
    of certain orders. In the case of the moonshine module,
    we need the −1−1 automorphism of Leech, which isn't particularly
    special for lattices. Conjecturally (see work of Dong,
    Mason, and Montague 1994-95), we could use any fixed-point
    free automorphism of Leech to get an isomorphic VOA,
    and that is somewhat more special.
    
    One class of "baby examples" that arise is when you take
    the root lattice of a simple (or more generally, reductive)
    algebraic group. This lattice has an action of the Weyl
    group. The lattice vertex operator algebra of this lattice
    has an action of the corresponding Kac-Moody Lie algebra
    (more generally, I think the centrally extended loop
    group acts). This is one of the more natural ways to
    construct E8E8 from its lattice.


https://mathoverflow.net/questions/14402/semiadditivity-and-dualizability-of-2
    A dual for an object X of C is another object X* together
    with maps 1 → X ⊗ X* and X* ⊗ X → 1 which satisfy the
    triangular identities; see wikipedia for more details.
    The data of X* together with these maps is unique up
    to unique isomorphism if it exists, so it makes sense
    to ask whether an object has a dual or not.

    There are actually different ways to categorify the concept
    of rig and get a notion of "2-rig", but one nice way
    is to define it as a category with colimits equipped
    with a monoidal structure that distributes over the colimits.
    Having colimits is like having addition; the monoidal
    structure is like multiplication. We call a 2-rig "symmetric"
    if the monoidal structure is symmetric; this is like
    being commutative. The most important 2-rig of all is
    the category Set, since this is the free 2-rig on no
    generators. It's also the free symmetric 2-rig on no generators.
    
    The free commutative rig on one generator is N[x], the
    rig of polynomials in x with natural number coefficients.
    We need to do a kind of "completion" process, throwing
    in certain infinite sums, to get N[[x]], the rig of formal
    power series in x with natural number coefficients. The
    theory of 2-rigs allows infinite sums automatically,
    so the free symmetric 2-rig on one generator is called
    Set[[x]] - and this is the category of structure types!
    Addition and multiplication in this 2-rig turn out to
    work exactly as I've already described.
    
    There's a lot more to say about this, but the interesting
    thing to me now is that when we q-deform Set[[x]], we
    get the category of structures on projective spaces over
    the field with q elements. And the really interesting
    part is that while this is a monoidal category, it's
    no longer symmetric. However, it's almost braided. Actually,
    Joyal and Street showed this in a related situation,
    namely where one considers not a set of structures on
    a projective space, but a complex vector space of structures:

Bimonoidal Structure of Probability Monads
Tobias Fritz, Paolo Perrone
https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03527
    ...a semicartesian monoidal category is a monoidal category in which the
    monoidal unit 1 is a terminal object. For probability theory, this is a very appealing
    feature of a category, because such an object can be interpreted as a trivial space, having
    only one possible state. In other words, the object 1 would have the property that for
    every object X, X ⊗ 1 ∼= X (monoidal unit), so that tensoring with 1 does not increase
    the number of possible states, and moreover there is a unique map ! : X → 1 (terminal
    object), which we can think of as “forgetting the state of X”. Cartesian monoidal
    categories are in particular semicartesian.

    In the bicategorical context, duals are also frequently called adjoints, since in
    the bicategory Cat (see Remark 3.5) a dual pair is just an adjoint pair of functors.

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613092/a-quantum-experiment-suggests-theres-no-such-thing-as-objective-reality/
A quantum experiment suggests there’s no such thing as objective reality
Physicists have long suspected that quantum mechanics
allows two observers to experience different, conflicting
realities. Now they’ve performed the first experiment
that proves it.


https://aeon.co/ideas/descartes-was-wrong-a-person-is-a-person-through-other-persons
According to Ubuntu philosophy, which has its origins
in ancient Africa, a newborn baby is not a person. People
are born without ‘ena’, or selfhood, and instead must
acquire it through interactions and experiences over
time. So the ‘self’/‘other’ distinction that’s axiomatic
in Western philosophy is much blurrier in Ubuntu thought.
As the Kenyan-born philosopher John Mbiti put it in African
Religions and Philosophy (1975): ‘I am because we are,
and since we are, therefore I am.’

 Duality
As demonstrated by Wegner[35], a general Ising model
with the partition function (4) has a dual representation, which is a generalization of Kramers-Wannier[37]
duality. The same duality has been first established in
coding theory by MacWilliams[38] as a relation between
weight polynomials of two dual codes.

So I wrote a story for @WiredUK on #quantum computing.
Amount of hype & misconceptions around it is insane!

 @Microsoft thinks it's smarter than NISQ & ions folks
& working on topological qubits, 3rd approach. After
years of research, it's still to make a single one. If
it does, it'll be of much better quality than NISQ/ions
& it'll be easier to scale.

SDiff = category of smooth manifolds. 

A group object in Set is a group.
A group object internel to SDiff is a Lie group.
A group object in Grp is an abelian group.
A group object in Cat is a strict 2-group.
A group object in CRingop ^{op} is a commutative Hopf algebra.

Internal monoids in monoidal categories:
    A monoid object internal to (Ab, \otimes) is a ring
    A monoid object internal to (Vect, \otimes) is a ring
    A monoid object internal to (Cat, \times) is a strict monoidal category

    A commutative monoid object internal to (Vect_k, \otimes) is
        a commutative k-algebra.
    
A category object internal to Vect is a (Baez-Crans) 2-vector space.

A category object internal to Grp is a crossed module of groups.

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/formal+group
A formal group is a group object internal to infinitesimal spaces.
    More general than Lie algebras, which are group objects
    in first order infinitesimal spaces, formal groups may
    be of arbitrary infinitesimal order. They sit between
    Lie algebras and finite Lie groups or algebraic groups.
    
    Since infinitesimal spaces are typically modeled as formal
    duals to algebras, formal groups are typically conceived
    as group objects in formal duals to formal power series algebras.
    
    Specifically, fixing a formal coordinate chart, then
    the product operation of a formal group is entirely expressed
    as a formal power series in two variables, satisfying conditions.

An algebraic group is a group object in the category of algebraic varieties
    eg. SL(n)

An affine algebraic group is a group object in the category of affine varieties

A linear algebraic group is a Zariski-closed subgroup of GL(n).

Theorem: An algebraic group is linear iff it is affine.

A group scheme (over R) is a group object in the category of schemes over a commutative ring R.
An affine group scheme has underlying scheme affine.
The category of affine group schemes is the opposite of the category of commutative Hopf algebras.

Given a field, k, a connected algebraic group has underlying variety projective.
These are commutative, and called abelian varieties.
In dimension 1 these are the elliptic curves.


Bicategory, aka weak 2-category

For example:
given a base category C,
a span a -|-> b is a diagram:
    a <-- v --> b
The bicategory span(C) has
    0-cells : objects of C
    1-cells : spans of C with composition the pullback:

              v <-- u --> w
              |           |
              |           |
              V           V
        a <-- v --> b <-- w --> c

    2-cells : maps x:v-->v' such that

        a <-- v  --> b
        |     |      |
       =|    x|      |=

We may generalize the notion of ‘monoid’
to that of a monoid object in any monoidal category.
The notion of ‘monoidal category’ is a categorification of the notion of ‘monoid'.

the microcosm principle:
    certain algebraic structures can be defined in any category
    equipped with a categorified version of the same structure.

eg. HDA0, commutative monoid object in a symmetric monoidal category.

The Mathematics of Joan Birman

Birman exact sequence:
    1 -> pi_1(C_n(S), P) -> MCG(S, P) -> MCG(S) -> 1
    As a special case,
    when S is the disk, we conclude that B_n is isomorphic to
    the mapping class group of a disk with n marked points.

Surface of genus g: S_g
Torelli group: I(S_g)
Short exact sequence:
    1 -> I(S_g) -> MCG(S_g) -> Sp_{2g}(Z) -> 1
Sp_{2g}(Z) is isomorphic to the automorphism 
group of H_1(S_g, Z), which is the symplectic
space Z^{2g} with symplectic form the algebraic
intersection form.

In any short exact sequence of groups
    1 -> H -> G -> E -> 1
the defining relations of E correspond to
generators of H.

Generators of I(S_g) correspond to Dehn twists
around separating curves, and bounding pair maps:
    T_a T_b^{-1}
where a and b are disjoint, homologous, nonseparating curves.

The manifold M = PSL_2(R) / PSL_2(Z)
is homeomorphic to the complement in S^3
of the trefoil knot, and also the unit tangent
bundle of the modular surface 
    H / PSL_2(Z).
This bundle has a geodesic flow, closed orbits
of which are in bijection with Lorentz knots.

https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/cobordism.pdf
    The cobordism hypothesis was conjectured by Baez-Dolan
    [BD] in the mid 1990s. It has now
    been proved by Hopkins-Lurie in dimension two and by
    Lurie in higher dimensions. There are many
    complicated foundational issues which lie behind the
    definitions and the proof, and only a detailed
    sketch [L1] has appeared so far.1 The history of the
    Baez-Dolan conjecture goes most directly
    through quantum field theory and its adaptation to low-dimensional
    topology. Yet in retrospect it
    is a theorem about the structure of manifolds in all
    dimensions, and at the core of the proof lies
    Morse theory. Hence there are two routes to the cobordism
    hypothesis: algebraic topology and
    quantum field theory.

    The honeycomb lattice mentioned in the article resonated with me.
    I’ll go out on a limb and share a personal anecdote:
    In high school I took magic mushrooms with my friends,
    and at one point in the experience the world disappeared
    and I saw an undulating fabric in a honeycomb pattern.
    In the center of each “hole” in the fabric was a link
    to a memory, a time and a place.

    As demonstrated by Wegner[35], a general Ising model
    with the partition function (4) has a dual representation,
    which is a generalization of Kramers-Wannier[37]
    duality. The same duality has been first established in
    coding theory by MacWilliams[38] as a relation between
    weight polynomials of two dual codes.

irreducible representations behave like elementary particle species?
Under which conditions is such a tensor category the
representation category of some group, and if so, of
which kind of group?
Every  k-linear tensor category is of this form;
the class of groups arising this way are precisely the (algebraic) super-groups.

Simons Institute Open Lecture: The Unreasonable Effectiveness
of Spectral Graph Theory: A Confluence of Algorithms,
Geometry, and Physics
Starting with a basic physical process (heat diffusion),
we will recall how the evolution of the system can be
understood in terms of eigenmodes and their associated
eigenvalues. The physical view has immediate computational
import; for instance, Google models its users as agents
diffusing over the web graph. This family of ideas describes
the "reasonable" effectiveness of spectral graph theory.
But then we will see that spectral objects can also precisely
describe other phenomena in a surprisingly unreasonable
way. This will lead us to confront some of the most fundamental
problems in algorithms and complexity theory from a spectral
perspective.


I have another random question... i'm wondering if the
genus of a complex curve is assocated with a level of
categorification ... if you have noticed anything like this.
So, a genus 3 curve would correspond somehow to a 3-category.
I've been reading about jacobian varieties, and there
is a sense in which this genus indexes a dimension of
a torus. But my question here is slightly different.
I guess if you consider n-dimensional spaces and n-categories
as the same (somehow!) then the answer to my above question is yes...
This question is really motivated from quantum codes
& topological field theory stuff, but it's entirely possible
that I have no clue what i'm talking about.

Two-dimensional algebra in lattice gauge theory

    Over the years, I’ve developed what I call the Minus-Sign
    Test, a reliable way to rate popularizations of quantum
    mechanics.  To pass the Minus-Sign Test, all a popularization
    needs to do is mention the minus signs: i.e., interference
    between positive and negative amplitudes, the defining
    feature of quantum mechanics, the thing that makes it
    different from classical probability theory, the reason
    why we can’t say Schrödinger’s cat is “really either
    dead or alive,” and we simply don’t know which one, the
    reason why the entangled particles can’t have just agreed
    in advance that one would spin up and the other would
    spin down.  Another name for the Minus-Sign Test is the
    High-School Student Test, since it’s the thing that determines
    whether a bright high-school student, meeting quantum
    mechanics for the first time through the popularization,
    would come away thinking of superposition as
    
    (a) one of the coolest discoveries about Nature ever made, or
    (b) a synonym used by some famous authority figures for ignorance.
    
    Despite the low bar set by the Minus-Sign Test, I’m afraid
    almost every popular article about quantum mechanics
    ever written has failed it, the present piece included.

    This assumption -- that understanding a system's constituent
    parts means we also understand the causes within the
    system -- is not limited to the pharmaceutical industry
    or even to biology. It defines modern science. In general,
    we believe that the so-called problem of causation can
    be cured by more information. Scientists refer to this
    process as reductionism. By breaking down a process,
    we can see how everything fits together; the complex
    mystery is distilled into a list of ingredients. 

    ...
    The problem with this assumption is that causes are a
    strange kind of knowledge. This was first pointed out
    by David Hume, the 18th-century philosopher. He realised
    that, although people talk about causes as if they are
    real facts -- tangible things that can be discovered
    -- they're actually not at all factual. Instead, Hume
    said, every cause is just a slippery story, a catchy
    conjecture, a "lively conception produced by habit".

Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory
Brendan Fong, David I Spivak
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316


https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/08/04/causality-feedback-and-relations/
    Causality is an enchanting, seductive idea. Imagine:
    we interact with the world by giving it inputs, and the
    world responds by returning nice, easily predictable
    outputs. Life would just be so easy and pleasant if everything
    around us behaved as functions in the mathematical sense:
    for every input x there would be an output f(x). And,
    the cherry on top, imagine if f had a closed form. A
    nice little theory of everything.
    
    Unfortunately, reality is somewhat more brutal. In 1912,
    the year the Titanic sunk, Bertrand Russell published
    a very nice philosophical paper entitled On the notion
    of cause. It is full of delightful quotes, and here is
    one of my favourites:
    
        The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes
        muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age,
        surviving like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously
        supposed to do no harm.
    
    Clearly, Russell was a republican. But his paper is mainly
    a scathing attack on the facile idea of causality: viewing
    the various components of the physical world as cause-and-effect
    systems.

    Galois theory is one of the most beautiful branches of
    math because it explains the connection between topology
    (covering spaces), commutative algebra (field extensions)
    and symmetry (groups of deck transformations and Galois
    groups).  However, it's almost never taught this way.
    
    In the end it boils down to this: a map of commutative
    rings R -> R' is the same as a map of affine schemes
    Spec(R') -> Spec(R).  This is just the definition of
    affine schemes, but you have to see that affine schemes
    really are "spaces", and connected to topology.
    
    If R -> R' is monic, like a "field extension", then Spec(R')
    -> Spec(R) is epic, and often it gives a "branched covering
    space", like the Riemann surface for the function sqrt(z).
    The group of "deck transformations" of Spec(R') -> Spec(R)
    is the "Galois group" of R -> R'.

Homological Tools for the Quantum Mechanic
Tom Mainiero
(Submitted on 7 Jan 2019)
This paper is an introduction to work motivated by the
question "can multipartite entanglement be detected by
homological algebra?" We introduce cochain complexes
associated to multipartite density states whose cohomology
detects factorizability. The kth cohomology components
of such cochain complexes produce tuples of (k+1)-body
operators that are non-locally correlated due to the
non-factorizability of the state. Associated Poincare
polynomials are invariant under local invertible linear
transformations (automorphisms that decompose as tensor
products). These complexes can be considered as a step
toward realizing mutual information as an Euler characteristic.

     Llewellyn was a leading thinker of the school of thought
    known as "legal realism," and "The Bramble Bush" is also
    a major statement of that philosophy. In a famous passage,
    Llewellyn wrote:
    
        This doing of something about disputes, this doing of
        it reasonably, is the business of the law. And the people
        who have the doing of it in charge, whether they be judges
        or sheriffs or clerks or jailers or lawyers, are officials
        of the law. What these officials do about disputes is,
        to my mind, the law itself.
    
    He went on:
    
        And rules, in all of this, are important to you so far
        as they help you see or predict what judges will do or
        so far as they help you to get judges to do something.
        That is their importance. That is all their importance,
        except as pretty playthings.

    ...  Their magic is fragile, and can disappear if people
    who don't believe in it gain power. 



Jahn–Teller effect
    The Jahn–Teller effect (JT effect or JTE) is an important
    mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in molecular
    and solid-state systems which has far-reaching consequences
    for different fields, and it is related to a variety
    of applications in spectroscopy, stereochemistry and
    crystal chemistry, molecular and solid-state physics,
    and materials science. The effect is named for Hermann
    Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller, who first reported studies
    about it in 1937.

Amusing Permutation Representations of Group Extensions
    Wreath products of finite groups have permutation representations
    that are constructed from the permutation representations
    of their constituents. One can envision these in a metaphoric
    sense in which a rope is made from a bundle of threads.
    In this way, subgroups and quotients are easily visualized.
    The general idea is applied to the finite subgroups of
    the special unitary group of (2×2)-matrices. Amusing
    diagrams are developed that describe the unit quaternions,
    the binary tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral group
    as well as the dicyclic groups. In all cases, the quotients
    as subgroups of the permutation group are readily apparent.
    These permutation representations lead to injective homomorphisms
    into wreath products.

parabolic induction for GL(2, p)

GL(1, p) 
    has order (p-1) and
    (p-1) many 1-dimensional cuspidal representations

GL(2, p) 
    has order (p**2-1)*(p**2-p)
    Cuspidals come from non-trivial orbits of galois 
        group action on GF(p**2). 
    There are p*(p-1)/2 cuspidals each of dimension (p-1).
    Parabolically induced irreducibles:
        horizontal young diagram:
            p-1 many, 1-dimensional
        vertical young diagram:
            p-1 many, p-dimensional
        mixed pair of one-box young diagrams:
            (p-1) choose 2 many, (p+1)-dimensional

The Boom Hierarchy
Alexander Bunkenburg
    The Boom Hierarchy is the family of data structures tree, list, bag, set.
    By combining their properties in other ways, more data structures can
    be made, like mobiles. The paper defines the data structures of this
    extended Boom Hierarchy and shows how the functions reduce, map, and
    filter are applied to them

This is a canonical form for the generator
matrices of [n,k] linear codes, with n=4, k=2.
So we can count how many codes by counting
how many elements in each canonical form.

[4 choose 2] = 1 + q + 2q^2 + q^3 + q^4

[4 choose 2] = 35 if q==2

"Space does not notice time—or discrete moments, or separate units, of change.
Time is not an intrinsic characteristic of space.
The body—or even the totality of physical universe—is
“located” only in space, and only as the apparent simultaneity of mere existence.
Time is attention to change.
Time is a characteristic of mind, or attention, or “point
of view”. Time is a characteristic of an observer.
Time is a noticing.
Time is the effect of the mentalizing of the observed.
Time is a mental notation.
The mental notation, or noticing and observing, of time requires
attention.
Time is an act of attention.
Attention requires bodily “locatedness” in space—or the pre-
sumption of “point of view”.
The noticing and observing of the idea-process of time requires
bodily-“located” attention to “objectify”—or differentiate,
or “unitize”— the observed.
Time is the noticing of suffering.
Time is the reduction of the body, the universe, and
Reality Itself to the ego-scale of “point of view”.
If The Self-Nature, Self-Condition, and Self-State of
Reality Itself Is Intrinsically Self-Realized, “point
of view”, and time, and suffer- ing are Intrinsically
and Perfectly Transcended.
If the illusion of “present-time” is Transcended in The
egoless, Indivisible, and Acausal Self-Nature, Self-Condition,
and Self-State of Reality Itself, space itself is no
longer desecrated by “point of view”, and suffering, and time itself.
“Present-time” is a myth in mind." The Aletheon, Adi Da Samraj

Criticality without frustration for quantum spin-1 chains
Sergey Bravyi, Libor Caha, Ramis Movassagh, Daniel Nagaj, Peter Shor
Frustration-free (FF) spin chains have a property that
their ground state minimizes all individual terms in
the chain Hamiltonian. We ask how entangled the ground
state of a FF quantum spin-s chain with nearest-neighbor
interactions can be for small values of s. While FF spin-1/2
chains are known to have unentangled ground states, the
case s=1 remains less explored. We propose the first
example of a FF translation-invariant spin-1 chain that
has a unique highly entangled ground state and exhibits
some signatures of a critical behavior. The ground state
can be viewed as the uniform superposition of balanced
strings of left and right parentheses separated by empty
spaces. Entanglement entropy of one half of the chain
scales as log(n)/2 + O(1), where n is the number of spins.
We prove that the energy gap above the ground state is
polynomial in 1/n. The proof relies on a new result concerning
statistics of Dyck paths which might be of independent interest.

HOLOMORPHIC SCFTS WITH SMALL INDEX
DAVIDE GAIOTTO AND THEO JOHNSON-FREYD
Abstract. We observe that every self-dual ternary code
determines a holomorphic N = 1 superconformal field
theory. This provides ternary constructions of some well-known
holomorphic N = 1 SCFTs,
including Duncan’s “supermoonshine” model and the fermionic
“beauty and the beast” model
of Dixon, Ginsparg, and Harvey. Along the way, we clarify
some issues related to orbifolds of fermionic
holomorphic CFTs. We give a simple coding-theoretic description
of the supersymmetric index
and conjecture that for every self-dual ternary code
this index is divisible by 24; we are able to
prove this conjecture except in the case when the code
has length 12 mod 24. Lastly, we discuss a
conjecture of Stolz and Teichner relating N = 1 SCFTs
with Topological Modular Forms. This conjecture
implies constraints on the supersymmetric indexes of
arbitrary holomorphic SCFTs, and suggests
(but does not require) that there should be, for each
k, a holomorphic N = 1 SCFT of central
charge 12k and index 24/ gcd(k, 24). We give ternary
code constructions of SCFTs realizing this
suggestion for k ≤ 5.

Combinatorics of Polyhedra for n-Categories
Todd Trimble
September 5, 1999
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/trimble/polyhedra.html

    In these notes, we give some combinatorial techniques for constructing 
    various polyhedra which appear to be intimately connected with the 
    geometry of weak n-categories. These include 
    
    1. Associahedra (and "monoidahedra"; see below); 
    2. Permutoassociahedra, and the cellular structure of 
       Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of moduli spaces 
    3. "Functoriahedra" (related to the A_n maps of Stasheff) 
    
    Our basic techniques use derivations on operads and bar constructions. 
    In part A, we introduce derivations, which should be regarded as 
    "boundary operators" on (set-valued) operads satisfying a Leibniz rule. 
    Such derivations can be used to construct poset-valued operads; taking 
    nerves, one gets polyhedral operads. In this way we reconstruct the 
    associahedra and the Fulton-MacPherson compactifications.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23394/applications-of-algebraic-geometry-over-a-field-with-one-element
    To elaborate on the possible connection with the Riemann
    hypothesis:
    One of the parts of the Weil conjectures (which were
    proved by Deligne, and which also follow from Grothendieck's
    "standard conjectures") states:

    The zeta function Z_X(t) of a variety X is defined

    of F_{q^r}-points of X.

    Now if X=Spec⁡Z were somehow a smooth projective

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/160387/introductory-references-for-geometric-representation-theory

    I am currently reading though the two books already mentioned
    (Representation Theory and Complex Geometry by Chriss
    and Ginzburg and D-Modules, Perverse Sheaves, and Representation
    Theory by Hotta et al) and I definitely recommend them.
    Two other references that I have found helpful are:
    
    Fulton's Young Tableaux. This presents a snapshot of
    the geometry associated to GLnGLn (e.g. producing irreducible
    representations from lines bundles on flag varieties).
    It is also a relatively easy read!
    
    Humphreys' Representations of Semisimple Lie Algebras
    in the BGG Category OO. Whilst this is not so much about
    the geometric side of the picture, what I got out of
    it is an appreciation of the types of questions people
    in this area try to answer.

Local Homology of Word Embeddings
Tadas Temčinas
(Submitted on 24 Oct 2018)
    Topological data analysis (TDA) has been widely used
    to make progress on a number of problems. However, it
    seems that TDA application in natural language processing
    (NLP) is at its infancy. In this paper we try to bridge
    the gap by arguing why TDA tools are a natural choice
    when it comes to analysing word embedding data. We describe
    a parallelisable unsupervised learning algorithm based
    on local homology of datapoints and show some experimental
    results on word embedding data. We see that local homology
    of datapoints in word embedding data contains some information
    that can potentially be used to solve the word sense
    disambiguation problem.

Inspired by these ideas, Kauffman, together with Smolin,
conjectured that reality is fundamentally unpredictable
and creative. “Einstein starts with a pre-stated configuration
space, a block universe,” Kauffman said. “What if that’s
not how it happens? What if, from loop quantum gravity,
the universe builds itself, but you can’t say what it’s
going to build until it builds itself?” The universe
“is not an is. It’s a becoming.” Kauffman constructed
a non-deterministic metaphysics based not on probability—the
key concept of quantum mechanics—but on possibility.
The switch makes causation looser, allowing for more
wriggle room. Causation becomes akin to enablement.

    Nikolai Durov: New Approach to Arakelov Geometry.
    In Chapter 4 he defines an ‘algebraic monad’ to be a
    monad on Set which preserves filtered colimits. But,
    as Lawvere showed, this is just a painfully technical
    way of talking about an ‘algebraic theory’ — roughly
    speaking, a theory describing gadgets with some specified
    n-ary operations satisfying some specified equational laws.
    
    An example of the kind of algebraic theory Durov cares
    about is ‘the theory of R-modules’ for a ring R.
    In short, he doesn’t really generalize the concept of
    ring; he really generalizes the concept of R-module,
    replacing it by ‘model of an algebraic theory’ — that
    is, a gadget with some n-ary operations satisfying
    some equations.
    
    That’s a truly massive generalization. It runs the risk
    of vacuity.
    
    But, the really important rings in algebraic geometry
    are the commutative ones! So, it’s R-modules with 
    R commutative that Durov really needs to generalize.
    And, he does this using the concept of a ‘commutative’
    algebraic monad, which he introduces in Chapter 5. Again
    it’s easier to think of these in terms of algebraic theories.
    An algebraic theory is ‘commutative’ if all its operations
    commute in a suitable sense.
    
    What does it mean for an n-ary operation and an m-ary
    operation to ‘commute’? Well, for n = m = 1 it
    just means the obvious thing: two unary operations r
    r and s s on a set X commute if
    
    s(r(x)) = r(s(x))
    for all x∈X. If s s is binary and r is unary,
    we instead need
    
    s(r(x),r(y)) = r(s(x,y)).
    It’s fun to guess the general pattern from these examples!

     there ARE two incompatible observables on the two element
    set in Rel, according to the definition Ross Duncan and
    I wrote down in our ICALP’08 paper. Roughly, compatible
    obsevables are a pair of dagger Frobenius algebras which
    mutually form `scaled’ dagger bialgebras. One checks
    that on the two element set in Rel, highly remarcably,
    such a pair exists, namely
    
    delta_g = 0 ~ (0,0); 1~(1,1)
    epsilon_g = 0 ~ *; 1 ~ *
    
    and a misterious one
    
    delta_r = 0 ~ {(0,0),(1,1)}; 1~{(0,1),(1,0)}
    epsilon_r = 0 ~ *

    Negative numbers and complex numbers were regarded as
    absurd and useless by many mathematicians prior to 15th15th
    century. For instance, Chuquet referred negative numbers
    as "absurd numbers." Michael Stifel has a chapter on
    negative numbers in his book "Arithmetica integra" titled
    "numeri absurdi". And so too were complex/imaginary numbers.
    Gerolamo Cardano in his book "Ars Magna" calls the square
    root of negative numbers as a completely useless object.

    Monads are very useful in computer science, specifically
    logic programming. Haskell is a programming language
    which is extremely mathematical, to the point where programs
    and proofs are the same thing. It's a pure functional
    programming language, which means everything is a function
    and these functions are not allowed to have side-effects
    (you can't cheat to make Haskell do something for you).

    If the dimension exceeds 2, all projective and affine geometries come from
    finite fields. It's more complicated in dimension 2.
    A projective plane is equivalent to a Steiner system 
    S(2, n+1, n^2+n+1) for some n>=2.
    Ie. n^2+n+1 points, n^2+n+1 lines, with n+1 points on each line, and
    a unique line containing any two points. An affine plane is equivalent
    to a S(2, n, n^2).
    Define PG(m,q) as the m-dim projective geometry from the m+1 dim vector
    space over GL(q). Points are 1-dim subspaces, lines are 2-dim subspaces.
    A hyperplane is a maximal proper subspace.

    But consciousness is just one of many mind-body conundrums.
    Free will is another. Do our physical components—genes,

    do? Are conscious thoughts really afterthoughts, which

Quantum Mechanics of Identity:
Bosons, Fermions, Anyons
http://frankwilczek.com/2018/identity_01.pdf
    The existence of anyons - of many kinds - is firmly
    established theoretically, and by numerical simulation, in
    the fractional quantum Hall effect.
    But direct experimental demonstration, for example
    through interferometry, remains an open challenge. 
    Anyons are also predicted to exist in other states of
    matter, such as Chern insulators and spin liquids, which
    might offer cleaner access. 
    ...
    An enormous effort, lavishly funded by Microsoft, is being
    directed at producing and controlling “Majorana” anyons
    (majorinos).
    Majorinos are non-abelian anyons associated with
    specially designed vortex-like structures in
    superconductors.
    They could provide building blocks for topological
    quantum computing. 
    At the moment, the experimenters have produced
    individual Majorinos, but they have not demonstrated
    their statistics directly.
    That demonstration will be an early step in Microsoft’s
    ambitious program to make and manipulate many
    Majorinos within a scalable architecture.
    It will be disappointing - and surprising - if it is not
    accomplished soon.

    Intuitionistic validity commutes with all logical connectives:
    for example of "A or B" is valid then A is valid or B
    is valid, similarly if "exists x . P(x)" is valid then
    there exists an x such that "P(x)" is valid. With classical
    logic this fails for both "or" and "exists".

    Connectives are divided into positive and negative depending
    on whose turn it is to move in a dialogue. Classical
    validity only commutes with negative connectives, which
    are moves of the Falsifier.

Galois’s theorem
states that a polynomial equation in one variable has a solution by radicals
if and only if the corresponding ‘Galois group’ has a composition series with
cyclic factors.

    IBM has been dead since the 90's. Back when Lou Gerstner
    supposedly "saved" IBM from death he actually didn't,
    back then Real IBM the thing we think of as IBM actually
    died, and instead Zombie IBM took it's place (zIBM).
    zIBM is run as you say, like a hedge fund. Making products
    is incidental to zIBM and it doesn't care what it makes
    as long as somebody will pay (so it doesn't care if it's
    products are good or even usable). zIBM also implemented
    this infamous stack ranking system, the executives are
    terrible, and there are so many layers between management
    and action on the ground that the left hand has no idea
    what the right hand is doing.
    
    Management is so insulated from whats actually happening
    by all these layers nobody can effectively steer the
    organization, there are so many divisions and people
    that nobody can really track what is happening. The only
    thing that zIBM is actually really good at is managing
    its share price, and crafting it's artisinal financial
    statements so that nobody actually has any idea how bad
    it's doing. But we all know that zIBM revenue is declining
    for almost 10 years, so it's going to be a long slow
    crawl to zIBMs true final fiscal death.

The element in row G/K and column H represents the number
of points in the orbit (type) G/K fixed by H. By the
definition of the action of G on G/K, a coset gK is fixed
by H whenever HgK = gK. But this is equivalent to, g-1Hg
< K so that
m(G/K,H)=#{gK∈G/K∣g−1Hg<K}.
In particular, the diagonal elements are m(K, K) = |NG(K)/K|.
If H is not conjugate to a subgroup of K then m(G/K, H) = 0.
If K is a normal subgroup of G and H < K then g−1Hg⊂K for all g∈G, so that m(G/K,H)=|G/K|.
If G is Abelian then every subgroup is normal and so, again if H < K then m(G/K,H)=|G/K|, otherwise m(G/K,H)=0.

    Category theory is the theory of duality.
    
    Duality is of course an ancient notion in philosophy.
    At least as a term, it makes a curious re-appearance
    in the conjectural theory of fundamental physics formerly
    known as string theory as duality in string theory. In
    both cases, the literature left some room in delineating
    what precisely is meant. But the philosophically inclined
    mathematician could notice (see Lambek 82) that an excellent
    candidate to make precise the idea of duality is the
    mathematical concept of adjunction, from category theory.

    Historically, category theory was introduced in order
    to make precise the concept of natural transformation:
    The concept of functors was introduced just so as to
    support that of natural transformations, and the concept
    of categories only served that of functors (see e.g.
    Freyd 65, Part II).
    
    But natural transformations are, in turn, exactly the
    basis for the concept of adjoint functors (Def. 1.32
    below), equivalently adjunctions between categories (Prop.
    1.39 below), shown on the left. All universal constructions,
    the heart of category theory, are special cases of adjoint
    functors – hence of dualities, if we follow Lambek 82:
    This includes the concepts of limits and colimits (Def.
    3.1 below), ends and coends (Def. 3.13 below) Kan extensions
    (Prop. 3.29 below), and the behaviour of these constructions,
    such as for instance the free co-completion nature of
    the Yoneda embedding (Prop. 3.20 below).

    The pivotal role of adjunctions in category theory (Lawvere
    08) and in the foundations of mathematics (Lawvere 69,
    Lawvere 94 ) was particularly amplified by F. W. Lawvere.
    Moreover, Lawvere saw the future of category theory (Lawvere
    91) as concerned with adjunctions expressing systems
    of archetypical dualities that reveal foundations for
    geometry (Lawvere 07) and physics (Lawvere 97, see Def.
    5.2 and Def. 5.10 below). He suggested (Lawvere 94) this
    as a precise formulation of core aspects of the theory
    of everything of early 19th century philosophy: Hegel‘s
    Science of Logic.
    

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/objective+and+subjective+logic
    Lawvere 92: It is my belief that in the next decade and
    in the next century the technical advances forged by
    category theorists will be of value to dialectical philosophy,
    lending precise form with disputable mathematical models
    to ancient philosophical distinctions such as general
    vs. particular, objective vs. subjective, being vs. becoming,
    space vs. quantity, equality vs. difference, quantitative
    vs. qualitative etc. In turn the explicit attention by
    mathematicians to such philosophical questions is necessary
    to achieve the goal of making mathematics (and hence
    other sciences) more widely learnable and useable. Of
    course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics
    and that mathematicians learn philosophy.

Axiomatic Method and Category Theory
Andrei Rodin
(Submitted on 25 Sep 2012)
Lawvere's axiomatization of topos theory and Voevodsky's
axiomatization of heigher homotopy theory exemplify a
new way of axiomatic theory building, which goes beyond
the classical Hibert-style Axiomatic Method. The new
notion of Axiomatic Method that emerges in Categorical
logic opens new possibilities for using this method in
physics and other natural sciences.

    The second area is the Langlands program. Unlike the
    Riemann hypothesis, the Langlands program is named for
    the most advanced part of the theory, not the original
    question. But the roots of the Langlands program go all
    the way back to Gauss' Law of Quadratic Reciprocity:
    Given an odd prime q, let ϵ=±1 so that ϵq≡1mod4.
    Then for an odd prime p, the Legendre symbols (p|q)
    and (ϵq|p) are equal. More abstractly, the Galois
    representation arising from the Kronecker symbol (ϵq|∗)
    has the same L function as the Dirichlet character (∗|q).
    Langlands interprets the latter as an automorphic from
    on GL(1).

    You're certainly used to Bruhat-Tits theory for SL2SL2,
    or at least for PGL2PGL2, over QpQp, where one encounters
    the (p+1)(p+1)-regular tree. As you know, PGL2(Qp)PGL2(Qp)
    acts on this tree, and the stabilizer of a point is a
    maximal compact subgroup that is conjugate to PGL2(Zp)PGL2(Zp),
    and the stabilizer of an edge is an Iwahori subgroup.
    This I assume is a familiar picture.

Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups
J. H. ConwayN. J. A. Sloane

    there are a number of astonishing results in the book, and
    perhaps this is a good place to mention some of the most miraculous.
    - The occurrence of the Leech lattice as the unique laminated lattice in
    24 dimensions (Fig. 6.1).
    - Gleason's theorem describing the weight enumerators of doubly-even
    self-dual codes, and Hecke's theorem describing the theta series of even
    unimodular lattices (Theorems 16 and 17 of Chap. 7).
    - The one-to-one correspondence between the 23 deep holes in the Leech
    lattice and the even unimodular 24-dimensional lattices of minimal norm 2
    (Chapters 16,23,26).
    - The construction of the Leech lattice in 11 25 ,1 as wJ../w , where
        w = (0,1,2,3 .. " .24170)
    is a vector of zero norm (Theorem 3 of Chap. 26). (We remind the reader
    that in Lorentzian space R 25 ,1, which is 26-dimensional space equipped
    with the norm x'x=xr+'" +Xi5-xi6, there is a unique even
    unimodular lattice 11 25 • 1 - see §1 of Chap. 26.)
    - The occurrence of the Leech lattice as the Coxeter diagram of the
    reflections in the automorphism group of 11 25 •1 (Chap. 27).

the big galois group Gal(Q¯/Q) acts on the
l-power torsion points of an elliptic curve over Q for
some prime l, and defines a representation in a natural way. 

For an elliptic curve over Q,
serre's mod l representation is
    Gal(Q¯/Q) -> Aut(E_l) = GL(2, l)
where E_l is the group of l-torsion points on E.

    For abelian number fields, the Dedekind zeta function
    factors into Dirichlet LL-functions. Hecke characters
    are one-dimensional representations. For possible generalizations
    to non-abelian field extensions, you will require higher
    dimensional Galois representations and Artin LL functions.
    
    (Maass 1949) Maass wave forms of eigenvalue 1/41/4 correspond
    to 2-dimensional Galois representations, see Bump "Autom.reps...."
    Chapter 1.9. Similar things happen for modular forms
    of weight one (Hecke 1925). In general, automorphic representations
    and Galois representations are expected to be in a certain
    correspondence (the LL functions and the root numbers
    should be the same).
    
    A possible conceptual explanation for the importance
    of Galois representations delivers the Tannaka-Krein
    theorem. Roughly, this states that knowing the representation
    theory is equivalent to knowing the group. The group
    you want to understand is the absolute Galois groups
    (with a profinite topology) via its Galois representations,
    and understand the Galois representation via automorphic forms.
    
    Perhaps one famous example is the Taniyama Shimura conjecture
    and consequently Fermat's last theorem: A certain construction
    with the elliptic curve gave a Galois representation,
    and the later was then shown to correspond to an automorphic form.

Exceptional mathematics: data structure or algorithm?


-----------------------------

A linear cyclic q-ary code is an ideal in the
ring of polynomials over GF(q) modulo x^n-1.
Therefore: this ideal is principle, and every
codeword is a multiple of some generator polynomial.
This generator polynomial is the monic codeword of least degree,
and it is a divisor of x^n-1.

QUASIALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE OCTONIONS
Other examples include the higher 2^n-onion Cayley algebras
and examples associated to Hadamard matrices.
...for the octonions, the cocycle is a coboundary and can
be identified as the result of twisting k(G) by
a 2-cochain F. In an extension of Drinfeld’s theory of
twisting or ‘gauge equivalence’[1], any algebra
on which k(G) acts also has to be twisted to remain a
module-algebra. In this sense the octonions
are gauge-equivalent or the twisting of the group algebra
of Z2×Z2×Z2 by a 2-cochain, which we provide.

Matrix Representation of Octonions and Generalizations
J Daboul, R Delbourgo
(Submitted on 9 Jun 1999)
We define a special matrix multiplication among a special
subset of $2N\x 2N$ matrices, and study the resulting
(non-associative) algebras and their subalgebras. We
derive the conditions under which these algebras become
alternative non-associative and when they become associative.
In particular, these algebras yield special matrix representations
of octonions and complex numbers; they naturally lead
to the Cayley-Dickson doubling process. Our matrix representation
of octonions also yields elegant insights into Dirac's
equation for a free particle. A few other results and
remarks arise as byproducts.

    In the pictures I drew above, my elementary defects were
    the the vortex, with charge +1, and the antivortex with
    charge -1. But I can change what my elementary defects
    look like by making a gauge transformation. If I rotate
    all spins by 180 degrees, then I just change the signs
    of the two defects. But if I rotate all spins by 90 degrees,
    then the vortex looks like an electric charge, with field
    lines pointing radially (either inward or outward). The
    antivortex still looks qualitatively the same, buts its
    axes are redefined.
    
    So in some descriptions, the fundamental defects of the
    XY model don’t contain vortices at all, but only radial
    charges and “antivortices” of the sort that I drew. (This
    is the way it’s presented, for example, in Kardar’s book
    on the statistical mechanics of fields.)
    
    In that sense, the basic symmetry between clockwise vortices
    and counterclockwise vortices is a gauge symmetry. What
    you want your +1 defects and -1 defects to look like
    is your choice.

"How the hippies saved physics"
From the CODA:
    And yet a topic whose importance strikes so many physicists
    today as self-evident had been shunned for a full decade
    after Bell’s original publication, castigated as less
    than “real” physics. 

    ...
    Their concern, instead, was to broaden the physicists’
    range of approaches or methods beyond the hyperpragmatism
    that had marked the earlier Cold War years. They strove
    to expand the physics profession’s collective mental
    space, to push beyond what they considered a narrowness
    of vision that had hardened after a quarter century of
    instrumentalist thinking....
    
    But that practical, pragmatic mindset had blinded nearly
    the entire discipline to major breakthroughs like Bell’s
    theorem.

"The age of entanglement"
Louisa Gilder
p271
    Three months later, on October 1, 1990, Bell died of
    a stroke in his kitchen in Geneva, so sud- denly
    and unexpectedly that Bertlmann couldn’t even come to
    the funeral. He was only sixty- two,
    never having given anyone except Mary a hint of the terrible
    migraine headaches that he had suffered from all his life.
    In the year of his death, Bell’s theorem was still a piece
    of arcana, a vaguely suspect subject with roots
    in unloved corners of the subculture of quantum physics.
    A decade later, it would be the principal
    subject of whole issues of Physics Review Letters, and
    universities would be hurrying to create
    special labs entirely for the study of subjects made possible
    by Bell’s theorem. For those who now work
    in these newly wide-open fields, it is a frustrating
    and poignant irony that, if only Bell could have
    lived out his biblically allotted three-score years and
    ten, he would have seen such wonderful things
    begun by his half-secret hobby.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/26755/what-if-anything-makes-homogeneous-polynomials-so-great
    I would rephrase the question as "what is so great about
    projective space (as compared to affine space)?" I would
    give two answers:
    Projective space has a larger symmetry group: dimension
    n2+2nn2+2n rather than n2+nn2+n.
    Projective space is compact.
    The first is what you are using when you turn x2+y2=1x2+y2=1
    into x2+y2=z2x2+y2=z2 and then (z+y)(z−y)=1(z+y)(z−y)=1;
    the corresponding change of coordinates is a symmetry
    of projective space which doesn't pass to affine space.
    The second is why homogenous polynomials work better
    for intersection theory: intersections can't run off
    to infinity. It is also why point counting over finite
    fields gives nicer answers in projective space: point
    counting is related to cohomology, and cohomology for
    smooth compact spaces obeys Poincare duality.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/62820/pythagorean-5-tuples
    In the early 90s, I took a class from Victor Kac and
    in it, he explained a very beautiful way of generating
    all the primitive solutions for the Pythagorean equation
    for a sum of n−1n−1 perfect squares is equal to a perfect
    square where nn can be 3, 4, 5, ..., 10. Unfortunately,
    I do not know where in the literature this is described
    in detail. It might be in his Infinite Dimensional Lie
    Algebras book, but I don't know.
    
    The idea is to realize the solutions as the isotropic
    roots for a certain root system.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/272982/how-do-we-construct-the-g%C3%B6del-s-sentence-in-martin-l%C3%B6f-type-theory
    There is a generalization of Gödel's incompleteness theorem
    that is more naturally applicable to MLTT: Löb's theorem
    says that to prove P, it suffices to prove that P is
    true whenever P is provable. Symbolically, using ◻P
    to mean "P is provable", this is
        ◻(◻P→P)→◻P
    If you instantiate P with a contradiction (say, 1=0
    or ⊥), you get Gödel's incompleteness theorem:
        ◻(◻⊥→⊥)→◻⊥
    or, using the fact that ¬A is A→⊥,
        ◻(¬◻⊥)→◻⊥
    If your theory is consistent, i.e., if ◻P→P, then this becomes
        ¬◻(¬◻⊥)
    or "you cannot prove that there is no prove of false".
    In the standard phrasing of Gödel's incompleteness theorem,
    this would be "the statement 'there is no proof of false'
    is true, but unprovable".
    
    While formalizing theorems and proofs using natural numbers
    is standard in set theory, in MLTT, it's much more natural
    to formulate provability by giving an inductive type
    of theorems (also called types), and an inductive type
    of proofs (also called terms).

Parameters of Integral Circulant Graphs and Periodic Quantum Dynamics
Nitin Saxena, Simone Severini, Igor Shparlinski
    The intention of the paper is to move a step towards
    a classification of network topologies that exhibit periodic
    quantum dynamics. We show that the evolution of a quantum
    system, whose hamiltonian is identical to the adjacency
    matrix of a circulant graph, is periodic if and only
    if all eigenvalues of the graph are integers (that is,
    the graph is integral). Motivated by this observation,
    we focus on relevant properties of integral circulant
    graphs. Specifically, we bound the number of vertices
    of integral circulant graphs in terms of their degree,
    characterize bipartiteness and give exact bounds for
    their diameter. Additionally, we prove that circulant
    graphs with odd order do not allow perfect state transfer.

Periodic Graphs
Chris Godsil
    We extend previous work by showing that a regular graph
    with at least four distinct eigenvalues is periodic with
    respect to some vertex if and only if its eigenvalues
    are integers.

Constructing the Hecke-Algebra from the Burau representation




https://mathoverflow.net/a/222401/39775
    In Conway's book The Sensual (Quadratic) Form he covers
    Zolotarev's proof of quadratic reciprocity:
    
    The legendre symbol (a|m) is defined as the sign of the
    permutation "multiplication by a mod m". This happens
    to match up with the usual definition. (Note the Cayley
    type replacement of 'a' with the function 'multiplication by a').
    
    Then quadratic reciprocity is proved just using group
    theory, and as Conway points out this has no mention
    of square number or even prime numbers!

THE LEVEL FOUR BRAID GROUP
TARA E. BRENDLE AND DAN MARGALIT
Abstract. By evaluating the Burau representation at t = −1, we obtain
a symplectic representation of the braid group. We study the resulting
congruence subgroups of the braid group, namely, the preimages of
the principal congruence subgroups of the symplectic group. Our main
result is that the level 4 congruence subgroup is equal to the group generated
by squares of Dehn twists. We also show that the image of the
Brunnian subgroup of the braid group under the symplectic representation
is the level four congruence subgroup.

The Peterson Graph can be obtained by identifying the
antipodal points of a dodecahedron and it has S5 as
its automorphism group

Possibly the most natural way to see the action of S5
is to identify the 10 vertices with (5 choose 2) pairs
and say two pairs are adjacent iff they're disjoint. 

The Peterson graph has a nice description in terms of
the 4 points and 6 edges of a tetrahedron or PG(3,1)
if we abuse notation. The Moore graph of order 7 has
a nice description in terms of the 15 points and 35 lines
of PG(3,2). Now, PG(3,7) has 400 points and 2850 lines
and if there is a Moore graph of order 57 (warning! warning!
Many would conjecture that there is none!) then it has
400+2850 vertices of which at most 400 could be independent...
The fact that a large automorphism group has been ruled
out makes this an unpromising approach, but who knows?

    it should go on in the future.” Just as art consists
    not simply of works of art but of an “attitude, the artistic
    spirit,” so does science consist not in the accumulation

    “The ability to perceive or think differently is more
    important than the knowledge gained,” Bohm explained.

Between classical and quantum
N.P. Landsman
https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506082
    The relationship between classical and quantum theory
    is of central importance to the philosophy of physics,
    and any interpretation of quantum mechanics has to clarify
    it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly historical
    and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically
    rigorous, including over 500 references. On the assumption
    that quantum mechanics is universal and complete, we
    discuss three ways in which classical physics has so
    far been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely
    in the limit h -> 0 of small Planck's constant (in a
    finite system), in the limit of a large system, and through
    decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit
    is closely related to modern quantization theory and
    microlocal analysis, whereas the second involves methods
    of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection sectors
    and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical
    world does not emerge as a sharply defined objective
    reality, but rather as an approximate appearance relative
    to certain "classical" states and observables. Decoherence
    subsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that
    they are "einselected", i.e. robust against coupling
    to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of classical
    observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically
    define (approximately) consistent sets of histories.
    We make the point that classicality results from the
    elimination of certain states and observables from quantum
    theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation
    (as Heisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack
    of it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%27s_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras
Each Boolean algebra B has an associated topological
space, denoted here S(B), called its Stone space. The
points in S(B) are the ultrafilters on B, or equivalently
the homomorphisms from B to the two-element Boolean algebra. 

For every Boolean algebra B, S(B) is a compact totally
disconnected Hausdorff space; such spaces are called
Stone spaces (also profinite spaces). Conversely, given
any topological space X, the collection of subsets of
X that are clopen (both closed and open) is a Boolean algebra.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification
The Stone–Čech compactification βX is a compact Hausdorff
space together with a continuous map from X that has
the following universal property: any continuous map
f: X → K, where K is a compact Hausdorff space, extends
uniquely to a continuous map βf: βX → K.

this universal property, together with the fact that
βX is a compact Hausdorff space containing X, characterizes
βX up to homeomorphism.

if X is discrete, one can construct βX as the set of
all ultrafilters on X, with a topology known as Stone
topology. The elements of X correspond to the principal
ultrafilters.

The Stone–Čech compactification is naturally homeomorphic
to the spectrum of Cb(X).[3] Here Cb(X) denotes the C*-algebra
of all continuous bounded functions on X with sup-norm.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/223584/which-philosophy-for-reductive-groups
    The early decades of the theory of automorphic forms
    exhibited an abundance of similar-looking features, such
    as for Hilbert modular forms, Siegel modular forms, theta-series
    in the study of quadratic forms, and so on. But how to
    unify these into a single framework, treat both Maass
    forms and holomorphic forms on equal footing, understand
    the significance of Eisenstein series, etc.? It is precisely
    the unified perspective on the internal structure of
    all reductive groups and the analogous unification for
    the representation theory in Harish-Chandra's work that
    makes them an ideal framework for subsuming all such
    considerations into a uniform group-theoretic framework.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/27164/why-is-fourier-analysis-so-handy-for-proving-the-isoperimetric-inequality
    Experience with Fourier analysis and representation theory
    has shown that every time a problem is invariant with
    respect to a group symmetry, the representation theory
    of that group is likely to be relevant. If the group
    is abelian, the representation theory is given by the
    Fourier transform on that group.
    
    In this case, the relevant symmetry group is that of
    reparameterising the arclength parameterisation of the
    perimeter by translation. This operation does not change
    the area or the perimeter. When combined with the observation
    (from Stokes theorem) that both the area and perimeter
    of a body can be easily recovered from the arclength
    parameterisation, this naturally suggests to use Fourier
    analysis in the arclength variable.


https://mathoverflow.net/questions/243518/linear-algebra-in-terms-of-abstract-nonsense
    To my mind there are two classes of interesting categorical
    facts here, loosely speaking "additive" facts and "multiplicative"
    facts. Some additive facts:
    
    Finite-dimensional vector spaces over kk has biproducts,
    and every object is a finite biproduct of copies of a
    single object, namely kk. The categories with this property
    are precisely the categories of finite rank free modules
    over a semiring RR (the endomorphisms of the single object).
    These biproduct decompositions encapsulate both the idea
    that vector spaces have bases and that a choice of bases
    can be used to write linear maps as matrices.
    
    The single object kk above is simple, and so every object
    is a finite biproduct of simple objects. The categories
    with this property, in addition to 1, are precisely the
    categories of finite rank free modules over a division
    semiring RR.

Loop series for discrete statistical models on graphs
Michael Chertkov, Vladimir Y. Chernyak
    https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0603189
    In this paper we present derivation details, logic, and
    motivation for the loop calculus introduced in \cite{06CCa}.
    Generating functions for three inter-related discrete
    statistical models are each expressed in terms of a finite
    series. The first term in the series corresponds to the
    Bethe-Peierls (Belief Propagation)-BP contribution, the
    other terms are labeled by loops on the factor graph.
    All loop contributions are simple rational functions
    of spin correlation functions calculated within the BP
    approach. We discuss two alternative derivations of the
    loop series. One approach implements a set of local auxiliary
    integrations over continuous fields with the BP contribution
    corresponding to an integrand saddle-point value. The
    integrals are replaced by sums in the complimentary approach,
    briefly explained in \cite{06CCa}. A local gauge symmetry
    transformation that clarifies an important invariant
    feature of the BP solution, is revealed in both approaches.
    The partition function remains invariant while individual
    terms change under the gauge transformation. The requirement
    for all individual terms to be non-zero only for closed
    loops in the factor graph (as opposed to paths with loose
    ends) is equivalent to fixing the first term in the series
    to be exactly equal to the BP contribution. Further applications
    of the loop calculus to problems in statistical physics,
    computer and information sciences are discussed.

Generic emergence of classical features in quantum Darwinism

     emergence of classicality is a general feature of any
    quantum dynamics: observers
    who acquire information about a quantum system indirectly
    have access at most to classical
    information about one and the same measurement of the
    quantum system; moreover, if
    such information is available to many observers, they
    necessarily agree.

What is quantum in quantum randomness?
Philippe Grangier1 and Alexia Auff`eves2
    It is often said that quantum and classical randomness
    are of different nature, the former being
    ontological and the latter epistemological. However,
    so far the question of ”What is quantum in
    quantum randomness”, i.e. what is the impact of quantization
    and discreteness on the nature of
    randomness, remains to answer. In a first part, we explicit
    the differences between quantum and
    classical randomness within a recently proposed ontology
    for quantum mechanics based on contextual
    objectivity. In this view, quantum randomness is the
    result of contextuality and quantization.
    We show that this approach strongly impacts the purposes
    of quantum theory as well as its areas of
    application. In particular, it challenges current programs
    inspired by classical reductionism, aiming
    at the emergence of the classical world from a large
    number of quantum systems. In a second part,
    we analyze quantum physics and thermodynamics as theories
    of randomness, unveiling their mutual
    influences. We finally consider new technological applications
    of quantum randomness opened in
    the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.

Sequential Measurement Characterises Quantum Theory
John van de Wetering∗
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11139.pdf
    We study general physical systems with a notion of sequential
    measurement that satisfies a few simple
    and intuitive conditions. We show that, apart from two
    exceptional cases, the systems satisfying
    these conditions are exactly the real, complex or quaternionic
    quantum systems. Moreover, only the
    complex quantum systems remain if systems must be allowed
    to be composed together in a locally
    tomographic manner. In other words, quantum theory is
    the unique locally tomographic theory
    allowing sequential measurement.


Uniqueness of Composition in Quantum Theory and Linguistics
Coecke et al
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00708.pdf
    We derive a uniqueness result for non-Cartesian composition
    of systems in a large class of process
    theories, with important implications for quantum theory
    and linguistics. Specifically, we consider
    theories of wavefunctions valued in commutative involutive
    semirings—as modelled by categories
    of free finite-dimensional modules—and we prove that
    the only bilinear compact-closed symmetric
    monoidal structure is the canonical one (up to linear
    monoidal equivalence). Our results apply
    to conventional quantum theory and other toy theories
    of interest in the literature, such as real
    quantum theory, relational quantum theory, hyperbolic
    quantum theory and modal quantum theory. In
    computational linguistics they imply that linear models
    for categorical compositional distributional
    semantics (DisCoCat)—such as vector spaces, sets and
    relations, and sets and histograms—admit an
    (essentially) unique compatible pregroup grammar

    In his remarkable book The Theory of Singularities and

    of A. B. Givental, which asserts that the symmetry group
    of the icosahedron is secretly lurking in the problem
    of finding the shortest path from one point to another
    in a region of the plane. Via Huygen's principle, this
    problem is connected to the motion of waves in such a region.

AMBIGUITY THEORY, OLD AND NEW
YVES ANDRE
Abstract. This is a introductory survey of some recent developments of “Galois
ideas” in Arithmetic, Complex Analysis, Transcendental Number Theory
and Quantum Field Theory, and of some of their interrelations.
    Ambiguity theory was the name which Galois used when he referred to his
    own theory and its future developments. For instance,
    in his celebrated last letter
    (1832), he wrote:
        My principal meditations for some time have been directed
        towards the application of the theory of ambiguity to
        transcendental analysis. It was a question of seeing
        a priori in a relation between quantities or transcendent
        functions, what exchanges one could make, which quantities
        one could substitute for the given quantities without
        the original relation ceasing to hold. That immediately
        made clear the impossibility of finding many expressions
        that one could look for. But I do not have time and my
        ideas are not yet well developed on this ground which
        is immense.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2704/links-between-riemann-surfaces-and-algebraic-geometry
    Every Riemann surface is a complex algebraic curve and
    every compact complex algebraic curve can be embedded
    into a projective plane and drawn as the Riemann surface.
    
    There are lots of gems in this short statement. For example,
    as I said there is a way to count the algebraic forms
    in terms of inner geometry of algebraic curve. This gives
    some number, which could be 0, 1, 2, etc. On the other
    hand, if you draw a Riemann surface, you notice that
    it can be studied in topology and then it has the invariant
    called the number of handles which could also be 0 (sphere),
    1 (torus), 2, etc. It turns out this is exactly the same
    thing though defined in a completely different way by
    a completely different branch of mathematics.
    
    The whole algebraic geometry is, so to say, our attempt
    to make ourselves comfortable about this amazing connection
    between things we calculate (algebra) and things we draw
    (geometry).

    Not numbers exactly, but certainly Conway's games (and
    related game-like structures) have aroused plenty of
    interest in certain category theorists and logicians,
    as they can be used to give categorical (non-posetal)
    semantics for substructural logics. In other words, under
    the Curry-Howard paradigm of "propositions as types",
    where propositions are promoted to objects and proofs
    of propositions p⇒qp⇒q are promoted to morphisms p→qp→q,
    the structures of formal deductions are embedded in strategies
    for games.
    
    It was originally observed by André Joyal that Conway
    games are the objects of a compact closed category, where
    morphisms between games G→HG→H are second-player winning
    strategies for −G+H−G+H.

    We remain forever at the base of the sheer rock face

    also remain open to surprise; else we can never learn

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/37214/why-arent-there-more-classifying-spaces-in-number-theory
    Classifying spaces are widely used in algebraic number
    theory, but in slightly disguised form. A classifying
    space is really just an approximation to the classifying
    topos of a group. However the classifying topos is just
    the category of G-sets, which is exactly what one uses
    in defining group cohomology and so on. Or to put it
    another way, all the useful information in the classifying
    space is already contained in the category of G-sets.
    
    The comment at the end of the question is correct: group
    cohomology was discovered as the cohomology of the classifying
    space, and the topological constructions were then turned
    into algebraic constructions and removed from the theory.
    So in some sense all the group cohomology calculations
    are implicitly using the classifying space.


https://mathoverflow.net/a/12382/39775
    So we obtain a description of the set of primes that
    split in KK in terms of the modular form f(q)f(q), or
    more precisely its Hecke eigenvalues (or what amounts
    to the same thing, its qq-expansion).
    The Langlands program asserts that an analogous statement
    is true for any Galois extension of number fields E/FE/F
    when one is given a continuous representation Gal(E/F)↪GL_n(C).

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/570/deformation-theory-of-representations-of-an-algebraic-group
    For an algebraic group G and a representation V, I think
    it's a standard result (but I don't have a reference) that
    (.) the obstruction to deforming V as a representation of
        G is an element of H2(G,V⊗V*)
    (.) if the obstruction is zero, isomorphism classes of deformations
        are parameterized by H1(G,V⊗V*)
    (.) automorphisms of a given deformation (as a deformation
        of V; i.e. restricting to the identity modulo your square-zero
        ideal) are parameterized by H0(G,V⊗V*)

    where the Hi refer to standard group cohomology (derived
    functors of invariants). The analogous statement, where
    the algebraic group G is replaced by a Lie algebra g
    and group cohomology is replaced by Lie algebra cohomology,
    is true, but the only proof I know is a big calculation.

    Assume G acts strongly transitively on a thick building
    Δ. Let B be the stabilizer of the fundamental chamber,
    N the stabilizer of the fundamental apartment, T the
    subgroup fixing the fundamental apartment, and W the
    quotient N/T. Then (G,B,N) is a BN-pair,
    also called a Tits system, for G. In particular, you
    have the Bruhat decomposition G=∐w∈WBwB, plus
    lots more.
    
    In this case, take G to be GL(V), and take Δ to
    be the flag complex of subspaces of V. The stabilizer
    B of the fundamental chamber is the upper-triangular
    matrices. The stabilizer N of the fundamental apartment
    is the monomial matrices; the subgroup T fixing the
    fundamental apartment is the diagonal matrices; and the
    Weyl group W is the quotient N/T, which can be identified
    with the permutation matrices.

A Construction of Representations of Weyl Groups
T.A. Springer, 1978

    Let g be a complex semi-simple Lie algebra and A\in g a
    nilpotent element. Let G
    be the adjoint complex Lie group defined by g and denote
    by B_A^G the variety of Borel subgroups of G whose 
    Lie algebra contains A. Fix a maximal torus T of G
    and let W be its Weyl group. In this paper we shall construct
    representations of W in the graded cohomology H*(B_A^G, Q)

Why are the characters of the symmetric group integer-valued?
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/10635/
    The quickest answer is because all of the irreducible
    representations of the symmetric group can be constructed
    over the field of rational numbers. See the wikipedia
    article on Young symmetrizers for example 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_symmetrizer
    
    More generally, one can say that representations of any
    finite Weyl group can be constructed over the rational
    numbers. This is explained in one of Springer's papers:
    http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=491988
    
    Another reason is that one write down an explicit combinatorial
    formula for the values of these characters. This is the
    Murnaghan-Nakayama rule and can be found in many sources.
    One such source is Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics
    volume 2, Section 7.17, and Section 7.18 for its connection
    to the symmetric group.

    This points to an unusual property of symmetric groups
    and other Weyl groups which is much stronger than the
    fact that their characters take values in $\mathbb{Z}$:
    the representing matrices can actually be written over
    $\mathbb{Q}$. Of course, the price of this stronger statement
    is doing more work than just showing that character values
    (always algebraic integers) are rational

On Klein’s Icosahedral Solution of the Quintic
Oliver Nash
    From one point of view, the exceptional geometry of the
    quintic is a result of the exceptional isomorphism:
    A5 ~= P SL(2, 5)
    Corresponding to the exact sequence defining the level-5
    principal congruence subgroup of the modular group:
    0 → Γ(5) → P SL(2, Z) → P SL(2, 5) → 0
    there is a factorization of the modular quotient:
    j : H ∗ j5 −→ X(5) Iˆ −→ X(1)


http://projects.thestar.com/math-the-canadian-who-reinvented-mathematics/
“A motive is supposed to come with a product of l-adic
Galois representations, whose Frobenius eigenvalues would
be related to Hecke eigenvalues by reciprocity?” Arthur
wrote. “But could we not argue that the latter are closely
related to quantum mechanics-like spectra, being ‘momentum
observables’ in the sense that they commute with the
Laplacian/Hamiltonian?” -- Jim Arthur

Numerical and analytical bounds on threshold error rates for hypergraph-product codes
Alexey A. Kovalev, Sanjay Prabhakar, Ilya Dumer, Leonid P. Pryadko
    we analyze numerically the low-disorder
    portion of the phase diagram of the two random-bond
    Ising models corresponding to the ML decoding of (3, 4)
    QHP codes with i.i.d. bit-flip errors. For a CSS code with
    generators G = Gx and H = Gz, the corresponding Ising
    models have the free energies Fe(G; K) and Fe(H∗ ; K),
    see Eqs. (4) and (15), where e is the binary error vector
    whose non-zero bits indicate the flipped bonds, and
    K = 1/T is the inverse temperature. These models, respectively,
    correspond to the numerator and the denominator
    of the conditional ML decoding probability (5).

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph
    Every group character \chi of the group
    G induces an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of 
    \Gamma (G,S). The associated eigenvalue is 
    \lambda_{\chi }=\sum_{s\in S}\chi(s)
Really??? I think this is only true for abelian G.

    real numbers are not physically real. Moreover, a better
    terminology for the so-called real
    numbers is “random numbers”, as their series of bits
    are truly random. I propose an alternative classical
    mechanics that uses only finite-information numbers.
    This alternative classical mechanics is
    non-deterministic, despite the use of deterministic equations,
    in a way similar to quantum theory

    The Landsman-Reuvers proposal to solve the measurement
    problem from within quantum theory is extensively analysed.
    In favor of proposals of this kind, it is shown that
    the standard reasoning behind objections to solving the
    measurement problem from within quantum theory rely on
    counterfactual reasoning or mathematical idealisations.
    Subsequently, a list of objections/challenges to the
    proposal are made. Part of these objections are equally
    important for all attempts at solving the measurement
    problem, such as the problem of interpreting small numbers
    in the density matrix, the problem of reproducing the
    Born rule, the use of pure states as a tool to alleviate
    the interpretational issues of quantum states, and the
    necessity of introducing classical certainties which
    are not strictly present in quantum theory. The additional
    objections that are particular to the proposal, such
    as the physical interpretation/origin of the flea perturbation,
    the use of potentials to solve a dynamical problem, slow
    collapse times, the inability to handle unequal probabilities,
    and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead
    us to believe that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking
    in both physical grounding and theoretical promise. Finally,
    an overview is given of the challenges that were encountered
    in this attempt to solve the measurement problem from
    within quantum theory.

> Hi Simon,

> process, I thought it might be nice to work out on the side some things
> which we've learned from Jim (maybe you've done this already).

Yes, I'm very keen. I did a bunch of calculations of Burnside rings of
finite groups. Actually I wrote programs that did the calculations.
This was quite interesting, and closely related to this Gram-Schmidt
process.

One concrete question I have is regarding the dihedral group of order 8, 
which I will call B_2.
The treatment on the nLab focuses on the symmetric groups and the G-sets
coming from parabolic subgroups. There are other (stabilizer)
subgroups apart from these, and I found with B_2 that I could just use
all of the subgroups (up to conjugacy) when building the M matrix.

Then after row reduction, this matrix ends up with some zero rows, but
still manages to record the irreducibles in each permutation representation.

Maybe I'm not being very clear, so let me give some details.

There are 8 subgroups of B_2 up to conjugacy, and
here they are labelled A through H, along with a description of the 
corresponding "structure" stabilized:

    A order = 8, stabilizes nothing
    B order = 4, stabilizes a short axis
    C order = 4, stabilizes a long axis
    D order = 4, stabilizes an orientation
    E order = 2, stabilizes a corner
    F order = 2, stabilizes an edge
    G order = 2, stabilizes an opposite (unordered) pair of flags
    H order = 1, stabilizes a flag.

This description is with respect to the usual action on a square.
A flag is an incident corner and edge.
Each of E and F are conjugate to another subgroup, I think this
has something to do with the stabilizer of a corner also stabilizing
the opposite corner.
The subgroups E and F are the only subgroups that have conjugate subgroups. 

We can multiply (tensor) the corresponding permutation representations,
and there's a boatload of ways of describing this multiplication,
double cosets being one of them. James likes to talk about "geometric
relationships". 

So here is the multiplication table for B_2:

  | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
--+----------------------------
A | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
B | B 2B G  G  2E   H    2G 2H 
C | C G  2C G  H    2F   2G 2H 
D | D G  G  2D H    H    2G 2H 
E | E 2E H  H  2E+H 2H   2H 4H 
F | F H  2F H  2H   2F+H 2H 4H 
G | G 2G 2G 2G 2H   2H   4G 4H 
H | H 2H 2H 2H 4H   4H   4H 8H 

If we just count the double cosets we get this:

  | A B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
A | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
B | 1  2  1  1  2  1  2  2  
C | 1  1  2  1  1  2  2  2  
D | 1  1  1  2  1  1  2  2  
E | 1  2  1  1  3  2  2  4  
F | 1  1  2  1  2  3  2  4  
G | 1  2  2  2  2  2  4  4  
H | 1  2  2  2  4  4  4  8  

After row reduction:

  | A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
V | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
W | .  1  .  .  1  .  1  1  
X | .  .  1  .  .  1  1  1  
Y | .  .  .  1  .  .  1  1  
Z | .  .  .  .  1  1  .  2  

I got rid of the zero rows,
and the leftover rows are labelled by the irreducible representations.

As we see from the H column, B_2 has four 1-dimensional
irreducible representations, and one 2-dimensional irreducible representation.

I guess my second question is, how can we just blithly add and
subtract double cosets...? 

> As a computational side note: if the permutation representation P attached

> Q> can be represented as having a basis Stab(c) \ G / Stab(d)  consisting
> of double cosets.

This seems to have something to do with my question. Perhaps I just
need to do some more examples. My understanding of the usual representation
theory is not great, but it seems that the way they would normally
"kill off" a part of a reducible representation involves a summation
over the elements of the group while multiplying by a character
Something like that. (i really don't understand this very well.)
So I'm wondering if that is going on here aswell, "under the hood".

How to Draw a Group
Alexander Zvonkin
    Abstract
    A map is at the same time a group. To represent a map (that
    is, a graph drawn on the sphere or on another surface) we usually
    use a pair of permutations on the set of the \ends" of edges. These
    permutations generate a group which we call a cartographic group.
    The main motivation for the study of the cartographic group is the
    so-called theory of \dessins d'enfants" of Grothendieck, which relates
    the theory of maps to Galois theory [24].
    In the present paper we address the questions of identifying the
    cartographic group for a given map, and of constructing the maps
    with a given cartographic group

    Theorem: The group of rotations of the icosahedron is
    of order 60, simple, and isomorphic to the alternating
    group A5. Therefore, A5 is simple.

    icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 faces.

    The compound of 5 octahedra: Consider the construction
    of three orthogonal golden rectangles inscribed in the
    icosahedron. The six short sides are edges of the icosahedron,
    and we can paint them with the same color. Observe that,
    whenever an edge e is chosen, there is a unique way
    to build the rectangles in such a way that the edge e
    is one of the short sides, so in this way the 30 edges
    can be painted with 5 different colors. The midpoints
    of the edges of each color are the vertices of an octahedron,
    so we have formed a compound of 5 octahedra.

Butcher series: A story of rooted trees and numerical methods for evolution equations
    Butcher series appear when Runge-Kutta methods for ordinary
    differential equations are expanded in power series of
    the step size parameter. Each term in a Butcher series
    consists of a weighted elementary differential, and the
    set of all such differentials is isomorphic to the set
    of rooted trees, as noted by Cayley in the mid 19th century.
    A century later Butcher discovered that rooted trees
    can also be used to obtain the order conditions of Runge-Kutta
    methods, and he found a natural group structure, today
    known as the Butcher group. It is now known that many
    numerical methods also can be expanded in Butcher series;
    these are called B-series methods. A long-standing problem
    has been to characterize, in terms of qualitative features,
    all B-series methods. Here we tell the story of Butcher
    series, stretching from the early work of Cayley, to
    modern developments and connections to abstract algebra,
    and finally to the resolution of the characterization
    problem. This resolution introduces geometric tools and
    perspectives to an area traditionally explored using
    analysis and combinatorics.

"Spectral gaps of frustration-free spin systems with boundary"
Marius Lemm, Evgeny Mozgunov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08915.pdf
"""
A central question concerning a quantum many-body system is whether it
is gapped or gapless. (By definition, a system is “gapped” if the difference
between the two lowest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian remains uniformly
bounded away from zero in the thermodynamic limit. Otherwise, it is gapless.)
    The importance of this concept stems from the fact that ground states
of gapped systems enjoy many useful properties. For instance, they display
exponential decay of correlations [28]. In one dimension, more is known: The
ground states satisfy an area law for the entanglement entropy [2, 17] and
can be well approximated in polynomial time [3, 21]. Moreover, the closing
of the spectral gap (as a parameter in the Hamiltonian is varied) indicates a
quantum phase transition, and is therefore related to topological order, e.g.,
via the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem [16, 23]. To summarize, the existence of
a spectral gap is a fortunate occurrence that has far-reaching consequences
for low-temperature physics. (It is also rare in a probabilistic sense [24].)
    It is well-known that the existence of a spectral gap may depend on the
imposed boundary conditions, and this fact is at the core of our work.
    In general, the question whether a quantum spin system is gapped or
gapless is difficult: In 1D, the Haldane conjecture [14, 15] (“antiferromagnetic,
integer-spin Heisenberg chains are gapped”) remains open after 30
years of investigation. In 2D, the “gapped versus gapless” dichotomy is in
fact undecidable in general [10], even among the class of translation-invariant,
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians

An Introduction to the Cohomology of Groups
Peter J. Webb
http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/oldteaching/Year2010-11/8246CohomologyNotes.pdf

For H^2(G, A)
when G=C_2 x C_2 and A=C_2
there are eight equivalence classes of
extensions:
    1 of C_2 x C_2 x C_2
    3 of C_4 x C_2
    3 of D_8
    1 of Q_8  <--- quaternion group

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/11306/character-table-does-not-determine-group-vs-tannaka-duality
    From the example D4, Q, we see that the character
    table of a group doesn't determine the group up to isomorphism.
    On the other hand, Tannaka duality says that a group
    G is determined by its representation ring R(G).

Hodge Laplacians on Graphs
Lek-Heng Lim
    Abstract. This is an elementary introduction to the Hodge Laplacian on a
    graph, a higher-order generalization of the graph Laplacian. We will discuss
    basic properties including cohomology and Hodge theory. At the end we will
    also discuss the nonlinear Laplacian on a graph, a nonlinear generalization of
    the graph Laplacian as its name implies. These generalized Laplacians will be
    constructed out of coboundary operators, i.e., discrete analogues of exterior
    derivatives. The main feature of our approach is simplicity — this article
    requires only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory.

Towers of generalized divisible quantum codes
Jeongwan Haah
Sep 27 2017 quant-ph arXiv:1709.08658v1
    A divisible binary classical code is one in which every
    code word has weight divisible by a fixed integer. If
    the divisor is 2ν for a positive integer ν, then one
    can construct a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, where
    X-stabilizer space is the divisible classical code,
    that admits a transversal gate in the ν-th level of
    Clifford hierarchy. We consider a generalization of the
    divisibility by allowing a coefficient vector of odd
    integers with which every code word has zero dot product
    modulo the divisor. In this generalized sense, we construct
    a CSS code with divisor 2ν+1 and code distance d
    from any CSS code of code distance d and divisor 2ν
    where the transversal X is a nontrivial logical operator.
    The encoding rate of the new code is approximately d
    times smaller than that of the old code. In particular,
    for large d and ν≥2, our construction yields a CSS
    code of parameters [[O(dν−1),Ω(d),d]]
    admitting a transversal gate at the ν-th level of Clifford
    hierarchy. For our construction we introduce a conversion
    from magic state distillation protocols based on Clifford
    measurements to those based on codes with transversal
    T-gates. Our tower contains, as a subclass, generalized
    triply even CSS codes that have appeared in so-called
    gauge fixing or code switching methods.

Eilenberg–MacLane spaces
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology#Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_spaces
    There is a related description of the first cohomology
    with coefficients in any abelian group A, say for a CW
    complex X. Namely, H1(X,A) is in one-to-one correspondence
    with the set of isomorphism classes of Galois covering
    spaces of X with group A, also called principal A-bundles
    over X. For X connected, it follows that H1(X,A) is isomorphic
    to Hom(π1X,A), where π1X is the fundamental group of
    X. For example, H1(X,Z/2) classifies the double covering
    spaces of X, with the element 0 ∈ H1(X,Z/2) corresponding
    to the trivial double covering, the disjoint union of
    two copies of X.

    For M a Riemannian manifold, one defines the
    zeta function:

    where 0 < \lambda_1 <= lambda_2 <= ...
    are the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of M.


"ZETA FUNCTIONS OF GRAPHS"
Graph theory meets number theory in this stimulating book. Ihara zeta functions of
finite graphs are reciprocals of polynomials, sometimes in several variables. Analogies
abound with number-theoretic functions such as Riemann or Dedekind zeta functions.
For example, there is a Riemann hypothesis (which may be false) and a prime number
theorem for graphs. Explicit constructions of graph coverings use Galois theory to
generalize Cayley and Schreier graphs. Then non-isomorphic simple graphs with the
same zeta function are produced, showing that you cannot “hear” the shape of a graph.
The spectra of matrices such as the adjacency and edge adjacency matrices of a
graph are essential to the plot of this book, which makes connections with quantum
chaos and random matrix theory and also with expander and Ramanujan graphs, of
interest in computer science. Pitched at beginning graduate students, the book will also
appeal to researchers. Many well-chosen illustrations and exercises, both theoretical
and computer-based, are included throughout.

Zeta Functions of Finite Graphs and Coverings, Part II
H.M.Stark A.A.Terras
Galois theorem (roughly):
    let Y be an (unramified) normal covering of X
    with Galois group G=G(Y/X).
    Then intermediate graphs correspond bijectively to
    subgroups of G, and subgroup inclusion H1<=H2 corresponds to
    covering Y>=Y1>=Y2>=X.

    A ``prime'' [C] in X is an equivalence class of primitive
    closed backtrackless, tailless cycles C such that C!=D^m, m>=2 and D a
    path in X. For brevity, we will sometimes refer to primitive closed
    backtrackless tailless cycles C as prime cycles.

Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics
John C. Baez and Jacob D. Biamonte
p132:
"""
both the Desargues graph
and the dodecahedron graph are double covers of the Petersen graph.
For a labeled graph, each double cover corresponds uniquely to an
element of the Z/2Z cohomology of the graph (for an unlabeled
graph, some of the double covers defined in this way may turn out
to be isomorphic). Cohomology over Z/2Z takes any cycle as input
and returns either 0 or 1, in a consistent way (the output of a Z/2Z
sum of cycles is the sum of the outputs on each cycle). The double
cover has two copies of everything in the base (Petersen) graph, and
as you follow all the way around a cycle in the base, the element of
cohomology tells you whether you come back to the same copy (for
0) or the other copy (for 1) in the double cover, compared to where
you started.
One well-defined double cover for any graph is the one which simply
switches copies for every single edge (this corresponding to the ele-
ment of cohomology which is 1 on all odd cycles and 0 on all even
cycles). This always gives a double cover which is a bipartite graph,
and which is connected if and only if the base graph is connected
and not bipartite.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-virtual-representation

We can force this subtraction to always make sense by
considering a weaker notion of equivalence of representations
than isomorphism. The Grothendieck group K0(G) of
representations of G is the free abelian group on isomorphism
classes of representations of G, modulo the relation that

[V]=[U]+[W] if V≅U⊕W

When X is a representation, we write [X] for its
class in the Grothendieck group. Because of this definition,
there are symbols such as −[X] in K0(G). But
there is no guarantee that there is any representation
YY such that [Y]=−[X] (in fact, for nice enough
groups and X,Y≠0, this never happens).

To answer the original question: a virtual representation
is an element of K0(G) that is not (necessarily)
the class of a representation of G.

    There are many uses of the word ‘spectrum’ in mathematics,
    and most of them are related. 
    In particular, the spectrum of a linear operator on a
    finite-dimensional vector space — that is, its set of
    eigenvalues — can be seen as the spectrum of an associated
    commutative ring.

    Let T:V->V be a linear operator on V with minimal
    polynomial m(x).
    End(V) is the k-algebra of linear operators on V.
    the homomorphism f:k[x]->End(V) sending x to T has
    kernel (m(x)) and image the subalgebra of End(V) 
    generated by T.
    So k[x]/(m(x)) is isomorphic to this subalgebra.

    perturbations of T lift the degeneracy of
    the eigenvalues, so that m(x) is the characteristic polynomial...

    the characteristic polynomial is the “continuous minimum polynomial”.

Let B be a finite type C-algebra.
Then B = C[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fk)
and Spec B is the variety cut out of C^n by f1,...,fk.

     if R is a commutative-ring type object in some category
    of geometric objects, and X is a geometric object carrying
    a sufficient supply of maps to R, then it is worthwhile
    to look at the ring of functions from X to R, as this
    object will carry a lot of information on X. In the
    other direction, it is often useful to study commutative-ring
    objects by trying to realize them as rings of functions
    on some geometric object, their "spectrum". However,
    even with this in mind, it is still quite striking that
    this approach yields so many anti-equivalences between
    full subcategories of geometric objects and full subcategories
    of commutative-algebraic objects. It is like the geometer/topologist/homotopy-theorist
    is walking on one continent, and the commutative-algebraist
    is walking on another, and yet they keep stumbling upon
    the exact same species of categories (only in reverse).

    ~~~~~~~

    Note that topological spaces are already very nearly
    defined to be dual to certain commutative algebra-like
    structures, namely their frames of open subsets. The
    simplest interesting case of this duality is a duality
    between finite sets and finite Boolean rings / algebras.
    One way to think about this conceptually is that the
    open subsets of a topological space axiomatize verifiable
    or semidecidable properties of a point in that space:
    that is, properties such that if they hold you can check
    that that's true, but such that if they don't hold you
    can't necessarily check that that's true. See this math.SE
    question for more discussion on this point. For example,
    the open sets in the product topology on {0,1}N{0,1}N
    correspond precisely to those properties of an infinite
    sequence of zeroes and ones that you can verify by looking
    at finitely many terms of the sequence. (Once we agree
    that verifiable properties are a cool thing to look at,
    we should also agree that we care about logical operations
    on them, like AND and OR, and this is where the commutative
    algebra-like structure comes from.)

    Why is FinSet so important, anyway? Well, one categorical
    property that categories of spaces often share that isn't
    true in general is that binary products tend to distribute
    over binary coproducts. This is true in particular in
    any cartesian closed category, such as Set, and any
    category with this property behaves in some sense like
    a categorified commutative ring (!). It turns out that
    FinSet is the free distibutive category on a point.

    ~~~~~~~~

    All these five equivalences Cop≃DCop≃D follow the following
    pattern: There is an object PP which, in some sense,
    belongs to both CC and DD. More precisely, there are
    objects PC∈CPC∈C and PD∈DPD∈D which are "similar" in
    the sense that for example they share the same underlying
    set, maybe more. Moreover, the hom-functor hom(−,PC)hom⁡(−,PC)
    lifts to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PC):Cop→D,
    
    hom_(−,PC):Cop→D,
    and likewise hom(−,PD)hom⁡(−,PD) to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PD):D→Cop.
    hom_(−,PD):D→Cop.
    Then in most examples it is rather easy to construct
    an adjunction between these functors, since unit and
    counit may be defined as "evaluation"
    X→hom–––––(hom–––––(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    X→hom_(hom_(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    For more details, see the nlab article on dualizing objects.
    This is the purely formal part. The nontrivial part is
    to determine the fixed objects of this adjunction. If
    we are lucky, every object is a fixed object, so that
    Cop≃DCop≃D. But often, we have to shrink CC and DD further.
    
    
    In Gelfand duality (2), P=CP=C "is" both an object of
    TopTop and of ∗Alg∗Alg (unital ∗∗-algebras), and the
    Gelfand spectrum
    hom–––––∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    hom_∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    is left adjoint to the function algebra
    hom–––––Top(−,C):Topop→∗Alg.



https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35629/how-is-representation-theory-used-in-modular-automorphic-forms
    the basic link to representation theory is that modular
    forms (and automorphic forms) can be viewed as functions
    in representation spaces of reductive groups. What I
    mean is the following: take for example a modular form,
    i.e. a function ff on the upper-half plane satisfying
    certain conditions. Since the upper-half plane is a quotient
    of G=GL(2,R)G=GL(2,R), you can pull ff back to a function
    on GG (technically you massage it a bit, but this is
    the main idea) which will be invariant under a discrete
    subgroup ΓΓ. Functions that look like this are called
    automorphic forms on GG. The space all automorphic forms
    on GG is a representation of GG (via the right regular
    represenation, i.e. (gf)(x)=f(xg)(gf)(x)=f(xg)). Basically,
    any irreducible subrepresentation of the space of automorphic
    forms is what is called an automorphic representation
    of GG. So, modular forms can be viewed as certain vectors
    in certain (generally infinite-dimensional) representations
    of GG. In this context, one can define the Hecke algebra
    of GG as the complex-valued C∞C∞ functions on GG with
    compact support viewed as a ring under convolution. This
    is a substitute for the group ring that occurs in the
    representation theory of finite groups, i.e. the (possibly
    infinite-dimensional) group representations of GG should
    correspond to the (possibly infinite-dimensional) algebra
    representations of its Hecke algebra. This type of stuff
    is the basic connection of modular forms to representation
    theory and it goes back at least to Gelfand–Graev–Piatestkii-Shapiro's
    Representation theory and automorphic functions. You
    can replace GG with a general reductive group.
    ...

    A modular form is a highest weight vector of a discrete
    series summand of L2(SL2(Z)\SL2(R)).

    It's really interesting to study the "Grothendieck group"

    It becomes an abelian group in an obvious way.
    
    For example, if A is the category of representations
    of some group G, it's an abelian category and K(A) is
    called the "representation ring" of A - it's a ring because
    we tensor representations. Or, if A is the category of
    vector bundles over a space X, it's again abelian, and
    K(A) is called the "K-theory of X".


A Rapid Introduction to ADE Theory

    To get the other Dynkin graphs, we "fold" these ones
    (the ADE Dynkin graphs, these are the affine Dynkin graphs)
    by replacing nodes by the equivalence classes of nodes
    under orbits of graph automorphisms. There are several
    ways of doing this. Repeated folding and reversing arrows
    and unfolding, yields, for example, the sequence: D4
    - G2 - E6 - F4 - E7. One may interpret the reversals
    in terms of Frobenius reciprocity.
    ...
    
    They are also being used in finding the spectral lines
    associated with the newly discovered C60 molecules of
    fullerenes. This provides a good example of the unity
    of mathematics and the nonsense of the distinction between

    Every (associative, unital) ring is a subring of the
    endomorphism ring of its underlying additive group. Rings
    act on abelian groups; groups act on sets. The universal
    action on an abelian group is its endomorphism ring;
    the universal action on a set is the symmetric group.
    Modules are rings that remember their action on an abelian
    group; permutation groups are groups that remember their
    action on a set. (Jack Schmidt)

    You can think of Cayley's theorem as the special case
    of Yoneda's lemma, where the category has only one object.
    If you take the additive version of Yoneda's lemma, and
    you plug in an additive category with one object then
    you get the desired statement for rings that's in Jack's

    As people have said, non-commutative rings are naturally
    endomorphisms of abelian groups. The first non-commutative
    ring people should have in their head should be M_n, I think.
    
    However, I'm surprised no one has brought up that commutative
    rings are naturally the set of functions on something.
    Granted, it takes a couple of semesters of algebraic
    geometry to make this true, but its the idea that motivates
    the theory. The first commutative ring people should
    have in their head is C[x], with Z as a second example
    where it seems tantalyzingly bizarre that everything
    still works (prime factorization, ideals, etc). Certainly,
    when I try to convince a skeptic that rings are awesome
    (which I have done a couple of times now), I wave my
    hands wildly and talk about how cool rings of functions
    on things are.

    2(|a|+|b|+|c|)≤|a+b+c|+|a+b−c|+|a+c−b|+|b+c−a|

    Hlawka's inequality which says that for any vectors x,y,zx,y,z
    in an inner product space VV we have

    ‖x+y‖+‖y+z‖+‖z+x‖≤‖x‖+‖y‖+‖z‖+‖x+y+z‖.
    Using x=a+b−cx=a+b−c, y=a+c−by=a+c−b, and z=b+c−az=b+c−a 
    we obtain the inequality in the OP.


https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19857/has-decidability-got-something-to-do-with-primes
    Goedel did indeed use the Chinese remainder theorem in
    his proof of the Incompleteness theorem. This was used
    in what you describe as the `boring' part of the proof,
    the arithmetization of syntax. Contemporary researchers
    often agree with your later assessment, however, that
    the arithmetization of syntax is profound. This is the
    part of the proof that reveals the self-referential nature
    of elementary number theory, for example, since in talking
    about numbers we can in effect talk about statements
    involving numbers. Ultimately, we arrive in this way
    at a sentence that asserts its own unprovability, and
    this gives the Incompleteness Theorem straight away.
    
    But there are other coding methods besides the Chinese
    Remainder theorem, and not all of them involve primes
    directly. For example, the only reason Goedel needed
    CRT was that he worked in a very limited formal language,
    just the ring theory language. But one can just as easily
    work in a richer language, with all primitive recursive
    functions, and the proof proceeds mostly as before, with
    a somewhat easier time for the coding part, involving
    no primes. Other proofs formalize the theory in the hereditary
    finite sets HF, which is mutually interpreted with the
    natural numbers N, and then the coding is fundamentally
    set-theoretic, also involving no primes numbers especially.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/58696/why-study-lie-algebras
Let GG be a semi-simple Lie group, let KK be its maximal
compact subgroup, let ΓΓ be a discrete subgroup of GG,
and form G/K.G/K. This quotient is called the symmetric
space attached to GG.

The Riemanian structure comes from an invariant metric on
GG, and so GG acts as isometries on G/KG/K by left translation.

If you consider the case G=SL2(R)G=SL2(R), you get SL2(R)/SO(2)SL2(R)/SO(2),
which is naturally identified with the complex upper
half-plane (on which SL2(R)SL2(R) acts via Mobius transformations;
note that the point ii is stablized precisely by SO(2)SO(2)),
which is also the hyperbolic plane. Other groups give
higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces (e.g. SL2(C)SL2(C)
gives hyperbolic 33-space), the Siegel upper half-spaces
(from symplectic groups), complex balls, and many other
well-known spaces.

If you now take a discrete subgroup ΓΓ of GG, you can
form the double quotient Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K. These are some of
the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics.
In the case of SL2(R)SL2(R), we know via uniformization
that all genus ≥2≥2 Riemann surfaces can be described
in this way. In the case of SL2(C)SL2(C) we get hyperbolic
33-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces
of abelian varieties, ... .

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K
for certain ΓΓ (so-called congruence subgroups) is one
of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the
function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially
their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured
to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand
and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for
learning Lie theory.

The Poincaré half-plane for informationally complete POVMs
Michel Planat
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06768
    It has been shown that classes of (minimal asymmetric)
    informationally complete POVMs in dimension d can be
    built using the multiparticle Pauli group acting on appropriate
    fiducial states [M. Planat and Z. Gedik, R. Soc. open
    sci. 4, 170387 (2017)]. The latter states may also be
    derived starting from the Poincar\'e upper half-plane
    model H. For doing this, one translates the congruence
    (or non-congruence) subgroups of index d of the modular
    group into groups of permutation gates whose some of
    the eigenstates are the seeked fiducials. The structure
    of some IC-POVMs is found to be intimately related to
    the Kochen-Specker theorem.

Interpretation of quantum mechanics with indefinite norm
Alessandro Strumia
    (Submitted on 14 Sep 2017)
    The Born postulate can be reduced to its deterministic
    content that only applies to eigenvectors of observables:
    the standard probabilistic interpretation of generic
    states then follows from algebraic properties of repeated
    measurements and states. Extending this reasoning suggests
    an interpretation of quantum mechanics generalized with

A Completely Top-Down Hierarchical Structure in Quantum Mechanics
Yakir Aharonov, Eliahu Cohen, Jeff Tollaksen
    (Submitted on 20 Sep 2017)
    Can a large system be fully characterized using its subsystems
    via inductive reasoning? Is it possible to completely
    reduce the behavior of a complex system to the behavior
    of its simplest "atoms"? In the following paper we answer
    these questions on the negative for a specific class
    of systems and measurements. We begin with simple two-particle
    example, where strong correlations arise between two
    apparently empty boxes. This leads to new surprising
    effects within atomic and electromagnetic systems. A
    general construction based on pre- and post-selected
    ensembles is then suggested, where the N-body correlation
    can be genuinely perceived as a global property, as long
    as one is limited to preforming a small set of measurements
    which we term "strictly local". We conclude that within
    time-symmetric quantum mechanics and under certain boundary
    conditions, high-order correlations can determine low-order
    ones, but not vice versa. Moreover, the latter seem to
    provide no information at all regarding the former. This
    supports a top-down structure in many-body quantum mechanics.


Introduction to Quantum Logical Information Theory
David Ellerman
    (Submitted on 15 Jul 2017 (v1), last revised 17 Aug 2017 (this version, v2))
    Logical information theory is the quantitative version
    of the logic of partitions just as logical probability
    theory is the quantitative version of the dual Boolean
    logic of subsets. The resulting notion of information
    is about distinctions, differences, and distinguishability,
    and is formalized as the distinctions of a partition
    (a pair of points distinguished by the partition). All
    the definitions of simple, joint, conditional, and mutual
    entropy of Shannon information theory are derived by
    a uniform transformation from the corresponding definitions
    at the logical level. The purpose of this paper is to
    give the direct generalization to quantum logical information
    theory that similarly focuses on the pairs of eigenstates
    distinguished by an observable, i.e., qubits of an observable.
    The fundamental theorem for quantum logical entropy and
    measurement establishes a direct quantitative connection
    between the increase in quantum logical entropy due to
    a projective measurement and the eigenstates (cohered
    together in the pure superposition state being measured)
    that are distinguished by the measurement (decohered
    in the post-measurement mixed state). Both the classical
    and quantum versions of logical entropy have simple interpretations
    as "two-draw" probabilities. The conclusion is that quantum
    logical entropy is the simple and natural notion of information
    for a quantum information theory focusing on the distinguishing
    of quantum states.

Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations
Anthony W. Knapp and David A . Vogan, Jr.
(scary book)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Abstract-Homotopy.pdf

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1534/induction-and-coinduction-of-representations

    If you have any homomorphism f: H -> G, you get a restriction
    functor f* on representations, but the existence of adjoints
    depends on the existence of certain limits, in particular,
    how large you allow representations to be. Formally,
    you get an induction f! that takes V to the tensor product
    over group algebras (or a fiber product with G if you're
    working with G-sets or G-spaces) which is infinite dimensional
    if G/f(H) is infinite. Similarly, the coinduction f*
    takes V to H-module homomorphisms from the group algebra
    of G to V (or H-equivariant maps from G). This also works
    for Lie algebras and algebraic groups without significant
    alteration - when working with Lie algebras you use the
    universal enveloping algebras in place of group rings.
    If your groups, algebras, and representations come with
    smooth/algebraic/topological structure, then the definition
    gets more complicated due to completions, etc.
    
    There is a fancy way to view representations as sheaves on
    a classifying stack BG, so the homomorphism f describes
    a pointed map BH -> BG, and the upper and lower stars
    and shrieks correspond to the usual sheaf operations.
    Sometimes people use derived versions of these functors,
    and apparently get useful results (although I don't recall
    any of them in particular). The induction operation can
    be thought of as a pushforward with proper (compact)
    supports while coinduction is a plain pushforward. A
    coinduced module tends to be "bigger", e.g., if you start
    with the trivial representation of the trivial group,
    the coinduced representation is the dual of the induced
    representation. Induction may use half-forms on fibers
    of a map, since the product of two half-forms is a volume
    and can be integrated along fibers to get functions on
    the target.


Modal quantum theory
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2929
    We present a discrete model theory similar in structure
    to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite
    field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation
    of this theory involves only the "modal" concepts of
    possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability
    measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes
    entangled states and has versions of both Bell's theorem
    and the no cloning theorem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer's_theorem_on_induced_characters
    Using Frobenius reciprocity, Brauer's induction theorem
    leads easily to his fundamental characterization of characters,
    which asserts that a complex-valued class function of
    G is a virtual character if and only if its restriction
    to each Brauer elementary subgroup of G is a virtual
    character. This result, together with the fact that a
    virtual character θ is an irreducible character if and
    only if θ(1) > 0 and {\displaystyle \langle \theta ,\theta
    \rangle =1}￼ (where {\displaystyle \langle ,\rangle }￼
    is the usual inner product on the ring of complex-valued
    class functions) gives a means of constructing irreducible
    characters without explicitly constructing the associated
    representations.

Yes, there's a category of that sort where the objects are groupoids and
the morphisms are (equivalence classes of) spans of groupoids.   But it's
better to think of it as a bicategory, at least.  I wrote about this stuff

2-Vector Spaces and Groupoids
Jeffrey C. Morton
https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2361
There are two major philosophies regarding how to categorify the concept “vector
space”. A Baez-Crans (BC) 2-vector space is a category object in Vect—that is, a
category having a vector space of objects and of morphisms, where source, target,
composition, etc. are linear maps. This is a useful concept for some purposes—it
was developed to give a categorification of Lie algebras. The reader may refer to
the paper of Baez and Crans [3] for more details. However, a BC 2-vector space
turns out to be equivalent to a 2-term chain complex and for many purposes this
is too strict.

    For subgroups H and K of a group G,
    there is a canonical natural isomorphism
    Res(G, K) o Ind(G, H) = 
        \sum_{g\in[K\G/H]}

Mackey functors on compact closed categories

https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2922
    Mackey functors, a concept going back at least as far
    as [Gr], [Dr] and [Di] in group representation theory,
    can be regarded as functors out of the category of spans
    in a suitable category E . The important property of
    the category of spans is that it is compact closed.

What Is “Fundamental”
October 28, 2017 to January 22, 2018
https://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules

    Interesting physical systems can be described in a variety
    of languages. A cell, for example, might be understood
    in terms for example of quantum or classical mechanics,
    of computation, or information processing, of biochemistry,
    of evolution and genetics, or of behavior and function.
    We often consider some of these descriptions “more fundamental”
    than other more “emergent” ones, and many physicists
    pride themselves on pursuing the most fundamental sets
    of rules. But what exactly does it mean?
    
    Are “more fundamental” constituents physically smaller? Not
    always: if inflation is correct, quanta of the inflaton
    field are as large as the observable universe.
    
    Are “less fundamental” things made out of “more fundamental”
    ones? Perhaps – but while a cell is indeed "made of"
    atoms, it is perhaps more so “made of" structural and
    genetic information that is part of a long historical
    and evolutionary process. Is that process more fundamental
    than the cell?
    
    Does a “more fundamental” description uniquely specify a “less
    fundamental” one? Not in many cases: consider string
    theory, with its landscape of 10500 or more low-energy
    limits. And the same laws of statistical mechanics can
    apply to many types of statistically described constituents.
    
    Is “more fundamental” more economical or elegant in terms
    of concepts or entities? Only sometimes: a computational
    description of a circuit may be much more elegant than
    a wavefunction one. And there are hints that even gravity,
    a paragon of elegance, may be revealed as a statistical
    description of something else.



https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/602632/induced-representations


The weakest statement one can make is that for any subgroup
H≤GH≤G and any complex irreducible representation ρρ
of GG, ρρ is a summand of some induced representation
from HH. This follows immediately from Frobenius reciprocity.

But there are much stronger results, which go under the
bracketing name of "induction theorems". Their common
feature is that they say that certain representations
of a finite group GG are obtained as linear combinations
of certain representations induced from certain subgroups.

FINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS
ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3411.pdf

A finite k-regular graph X is called
an eta-expander (0<eta) if for every subset
of vertices A of X, with |A|<= 1/2 |X|,
|bdy(A)|>= eta |A| where bdy(A)={y in X|d(y,A)=1}.

Theorem 1.1: there exist k in N, and 0<eta in R,
such that if G is a finite simple group of Lie type,
but not a Suzuki group, then G has a set of k
generators S for which the Cayley graph Cay(G;S) is
an eta expander.

holds for arbitrary non-abelian finite simple group:
"Finite Simple Groups as Expanders"
Martin Kassabov, Alexander Lubotzky, Nikolay Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510562.pdf

Proposition 2. A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 iff there exists 0<alpha
such that for every i, and for every unitary rep V of G_i,
a vector v in V which is “S-almost invariant” is also 
“G-almost invariant”.

Let X=Cay(G;S), k=|S cup S^{-1}| and Delta = 1/k A
where A is adjacency matrix of X.
Then lambda_1(X)=1.

Proposition 3.  A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 if lambda_2(X_i)<1-delta
for some delta>0 and for all i.
(Note: We do not assume that the sets S_i are of bounded
size. If Si are bounded then the converse is also true.)

Ie. If gapped then eta-expander.

Therefore: if not eta-expander then gapless.

"Universal lattices and property tau"
M. Kassabov and N. Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0502112.pdf
Let G be a discrete group generated by a finite set S. 
Then G has the property tau if there exists 
epsilon > 0 such that for every finite 
irreducible unitary representation
rho : G → U(H) on a Hilbert space H (necessary finite dimensional),
which contains an epsilon-invariant vector is trivial. 
The largest epsilon with this property
is called the tau-constant and is denoted by tau(G; S).
A vector v is called epsilon-invariant 
iff ||rho(s)v - v|| < epsilon ||v|| for all s in S.

Kazhdan property T implies property tau

About the course

The mathematics of expander graphs is studied by three distinct communities:
The algorithmic problem of finding a small balanced cut in a graph (that is, of finding a certificate that a graph is *not* an expander) is a fundamental problem in the area of approximation algorithms, and good algorithms for it have many applications, from doing image segmentation to driving divide-and-conquer procedures.
Explicit constructions of highly expanding graphs have many applications in algorithms, data structures, derandomization and cryptography; many constructions are algebraic, and lead to deep questions in group theory, but certain new constructions are purely combinatorial.
The speed of convergence of MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) algorithms is related to the expansion of certain exponentially big graphs, and so the analysis of such algorithms hinges on the ability to bound the expansion of such graphs.

Hecke's Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_theorem
The first converse theorems were proved by Hamburger
(1921) who characterized the Riemann zeta function by
its functional equation, and by Hecke (1936) who showed
that if a Dirichlet series satisfied a certain functional
equation and some growth conditions then it was the Mellin
transform of a modular form of level 1. Weil (1967) found
an extension to modular forms of higher level, which
was described by Ogg (1969, chapter V).

The "real clifford group" on n-qubits is generated by H and CNOT.
This is isomorphic to the finite symplectic group Sp(2n, 2).
|Sp(2n, q)| = q^{m^2}(q^{2m}-1)(q^{2m-2}-1)...(q^2-1)

Including the single qubit P gates:
P = [[1, 0], [0, i]]
we get the Clifford group C_n with 
|C_n| = 4^n |Sp(2n, 2)|

    It is proved that the ring of Siegel modular forms in
    any genus is determined by doubly even self-dual codes
    and the theta relations. The (higher) weight polynomials
    of such codes are proved to be the generators of the
    ring of invariants of a polynomial ring in 2g variables
    under a certain specified finite group. Moreover codes
    are uniquely determined by their weight polynomials.

The order of any finite field is a prime power, q=p^f.
These are unique for each q. F_q or GF(q).
F_p = Z/pZ
F_q is constructed from F_p by adding a root of any
irreducible polynomial of degree f over F_p.
It is also equal to the set of solutions of x^q=x in the
algebraic closure of F_p.

Chapter 4:
The theta functions associated to a Riemann surface

p137
closed genus g Riemann surface, g ≥ 1...
associate to this surface a 2g-dimensional torus – its Jacobian
variety.

p153
... The subgroup of \Complex^g that
they generate is a lattice. We denote this lattice by \Lambda(I, \Pi)...
The Jacobian variety associated to the Reimann surface \Sigma_g
endowed with canonical basis a j , b j , j = 1, 2, . . . , g, is
J(\Sigma_g) := \Complex^g / \Lambda(I,\Pi)

The additive group structure of \Complex^g is induced onto J(\Sigma_g)
and so this is an abelian variety.

    There are different kinds of equality. Let us say that
    equality is "intensional" if it distinguishes objects
    based on how they are defined, and "extensional" if it
    distinguishes objects based on their "extension" or "observable
    behavior". 
    
    To use Russell's example, intensionally the morning star
    and the evening star are clearly not the same (because
    their definitions are different), but they are extensionally
    the same because they both denote the same object (planet
    Venus). A more mathematical example is comparison of
    x+yx+y and y+xy+x. These are extensionally equal, but
    intensionally differ because (the usual) definition of
    ++ treats its arguments asymmetrically. It should be
    clear that two functions may be extensionally equal (have
    same behavior) even though they differ intensionally
    (have different definitions).
    
    It is possible for two kinds of equality to coexist. Thus
    in type theory there are two equalities. The intensional
    one is called "judgmental" or "definitional equality"
    ≡≡ and the extensional one is known as "propositional
    equality" ==. Mathematicians are aware of == as a "real
    thing" while they think of ≡≡ as "formal manipulation
    of symbolic expressions" or some such.
    
    We may control the two kinds of equality and the relationship
    between them with additional axioms. For instance, the
    reflection rule collapses ≡≡ and == by allowing us to
    conclude a≡ba≡b from a=ba=b (the other direction is automatic).
    There are also varying degrees of extensionality of ==.
    Without any extra axioms, == is already somewhat extensional.
    For instance, we can prove commutativity of ++ on natural
    numbers by induction in the form x+y=y+xx+y=y+x, but
    we cannot prove x+y≡y+xx+y≡y+x. Function extensionality
    is an axiom which describes what constitutes an "observation"
    on functions: by saying that two functions are equal
    when they give equal values we are in essence saying
    that only values matter (but not for example the "running
    time" or some other aspect of evaluation). Another axiom
    which makes == "more extensional" is the Univalence axiom.

The spectrum of a graph is the spectrum of its adjacency matrix.
J. H. Smith proved the following theorem.
    Theorem
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue strictly less than
        2 are precisely the ADE diagrams.
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue equal to 2 are
        precisely the extended ADE diagrams.
Although this theorem was proved in 1969, it is in some sense
implicit in the classification of simple Lie algebras over C.

My student Mike Stay did computer science before he came
to UCR. When he was applying, he mentioned a result he
helped prove, which relates Goedel's theorem to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle:
    C. S. Calude and M. A. Stay, From Heisenberg to Goedel
    via Chaitin, International Journal of Theoretical Physics,
    44 (2005), 1053-1065. 
Now, this particular combination of topics is classic crackpot
fodder. People think "Gee, uncertainty sounds like incompleteness,
they're both limitations on knowledge - they must be
related!" and go off the deep end. So I got pretty suspicious
until I read his paper and saw it was CORRECT... at which
point I definitely wanted him around! The connection
they establish is not as precise as I'd like, but it's solid math.

From HN:
Money as a medium, from McLuhan's Understanding Media, as an encouragement to think of cryptocurrency as a medial paradigm shift...
“Money talks” because money is a metaphor, a transfer,
and a bridge. Like words and language, money is a storehouse
of communally achieved work, skill, and experience. Money,
however, is also a specialist technology like writing;
and as writing intensifies the visual aspect of speech
and order, and as the clock visually separates time from
space, so money separates work from the other social
functions. Even today money is a language for translating
the work of the farmer into the work of the barber, doctor,
engineer, or plumber. As a vast social metaphor, bridge,
or translator, money—like writing—speeds up exchange
and tightens the bonds of interdependence in any community.
It gives great spatial expansion and control to political
organizations, just as writing does, or the calendar.

Domain theory
-------------

"Domain Theory" Samson Abramsky and Achim Jung
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.353.463&rep=rep1&type=pdf

A *pointed* poset is a poset with a bottom: _|_ .

Definition 2.1.8. Let P be a poset. A subset A of P is directed, if it is nonempty and
each pair of elements of A has an upper bound in A.

Eg. chains (totally ordered non-empty subsets)
Eg. finite subsets of a set.

Definition 2.1.13. A poset D in which every directed subset has a supremum we call a
directed-complete partial order, or dcpo for short


Eg. The points of a locale form a dcpo in the specialization order, see [Vic89, Joh82].

Proposition 2.1.15. A partially ordered set D is a dcpo if and only if each chain in D
has a supremum. (uses axiom of choice)

Proposition 2.1.16. A pointed poset P is a dcpo if and only if every monotone map
on P has a least fixpoint.

Definition 2.1.17. Let D and E be dcpo’s. A function f : D → E is (Scott-) continuous
if it is monotone and if for each directed subset A of D we have f(↑A) = ↑f(A).
We denote the set of all continuous functions from D to E, ordered pointwise, by [D −→ E].

Proposition 2.1.18. Let D and E be dcpo’s. Then [D −→ E] is again a dcpo. Directed
suprema in [D −→ E] are calculated pointwise.


Definition 3.1.15. Let D and E be dcpo’s and let e: D → E and p: E → D be
continuous functions. We say that (e, p) is a continuous embedding projection pair (or
e-p-pair) if p ◦ e = idD and e ◦ p ⊑ idE.

Either of e or p determines the other.

Proposition 3.2.2. The cartesian product of dcpo’s is a dcpo. Suprema and infima are
calculated coordinatewise.

3.2.2 continuous functions on DCPO's:
    apply : [D −→ E] × D → E, <f, x> |-> f(x).
    curry : [D × E −→ F] -> [D −→ [E −→ F]].
    composition : [D −→ E]×[E −→ F] to [D −→ F]

Therefore DCPO is cartesian closed.

Definition 3.3.6
    A diagram { (D_n), e_mn : D_n -> D_m with n<=m } is an 
    *expanding sequence* if:
    1. each e_mn is an embedding (the associated projection is called p_nm.)
    2. e_nn = id
    3. e_kn = e_km o e_mn

Theorem 3.3.7
    limit (equals colimit) of expanding sequence {D_n, p_nm} ( {D_n, e_mn} ). 
    Call this the bilimit of D_n.


4. Cartesian closed categories of domains

5. Recursive domain equations

5.2 Construction of solutions

I is the one-point dcpo as discussed in Section 3.2.1
Let D stand for any category of pointed domains, closed under bilimits.

Solve:
    X ~= F(X)

Take (bi-)limit of the sequence I, F(I), F(F(I)), ...

Main Lemma 5.2.2.
Let F be a continuous functor on D^e (subcategory of D with embeddings only).
For each embedding e:A->F(A) consider the colimit <D, e_n> of the
expanding sequence 

   e       F(e)          F(F(e))
A --> F(A) ----> F(F(A)) -------> ...

Then D is isomorphic to F(D) via the maps

fold    = lim_n e_{n+1} o F(e_n)^*  :  F(D) -> D
unfold  = lim_n F(e_n) o e_{n+1}^*  :  D -> F(D)

(where f^* is the upper adjoint of f).

Also:
    F(e_n)  = unfold o e_{n+1}
    F(e_n)* = e_{n+1}^* o fold.


Starting with the initial embedding e:I->F(I) gives
the *canonical* solution to X~=F(X).



p-adic numbers
--------------

Let p be a prime number.
Z_p is the inverse limit of the finite rings Z/p^kZ
It has no zero divisors, so we can form the field of
fractions, denoted as Q_p, the field of p-adic numbers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number

Semantic domains & p-adic numbers?
Fail: Eg. no hom from GF(4)->GF(2).
GF(4) = Z/2Z[X]/(X^2+X+1) = {0, 1, X, X+1}.
No hom because GF has no solution to X^2+X+1.

We show, in great detail, how the perturbative tools
of quantum field theory allow one to rigorously obtain:
a ``categorified'' Faa di Bruno type formula for multiple
composition, an explicit formula for reversion and a
proof of Lagrange-Good inversion, all in the setting
of multivariable power series. We took great pains to
offer a self-contained presentation that, we hope, will
provide any mathematician who wishes, an easy access
to the wonderland of quantum field theory.

Modular forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modular group SL(2, Z).
A *modular form* of weight k for the modular group is 
    1. holomorphic function f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = (cz+d)^k f(z)
    3. holomorphic as z->i \infty

A *modular function* is
    1. meromorphic f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = f(z)
    3. meromorphic at the cusp (i \infty)

The space of modular forms of weight 2k has
dimension 1 for 2k = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14.
No (non-trivial) modular forms for odd weight.
No (non-trivial) modular forms weight k=2.


??? 
A modular function is a meromorphic function on H^/SL(2, Z),
where H^ includes the cusp i\infty (and all the other cusps..right?).


Eisenstein series for the modular group:

G_{2k}(z) = sum_{m, n \in Z, Z != 0}
    1 / (m + n z)^2k.

Defines a modular form of weight 2k, with k>=2 an integer.
Use weight 2k to get even weight otherwise
sumation cancels out to zero.
Sum does not converge for k==1.

Any modular form can be written as a polynomial in G_4 and G_6.
Specifically, there's a recurrence relation for the G's.

With E_2k = G_2k / (2 zeta(2k) )

we have the fourier series, q=e^{2\pi i z}:

    E_4 = 1 + 240 sum_n ( sigma_3(n) q^n )
    E_6 = 1 - 504 sum_n ( sigma_5(n) q^n )

where sigma_a(n) is the sum of the a'th powers of
the divisors of n.

Lambert series:

    sum_n ( sigma_a(n) q^n ) = sum_n ( n^a q^n / (1-q^n) )
        for |q|<=1 and any a.

A *cusp form* has zero coefficient for the q^0 term.

Ramanujan identities involve differentiating E_2, E_4, and E_6 :

q E_2' = (E_2^2 - E_4)/12
q E_4' = (E_2 E_4 - E_6)/3
q E_6' = (E_2 E_6 - E_4^2)/2.

is the unique modular function $j$ such that:
    j(exp(2\pi i/3)) = 0, and
    j(i) = 1728.

Rational functions of $j$ give all
modular functions.

$j$ is a bijection between isomorphism classes
of elliptic curves (moduli space) and \Complex.

Moonshine
~~~~~~~~~

The q-expansion of $j$:

    j(q) = q^{-1} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 + ...

the coefficient of q^n
is the dimension of grade-n part of the moonshine module,
the first example being the Griess algebra,
which has dimension 196884.

The monster group was investigated in the 1970s
by mathematicians Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John
G. Thompson; they studied the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by subgroups of SL2(R), particularly, the normalizer
Γ0(p)+ of Γ0(p) in SL(2,R). They found that the Riemann
surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by Γ0(p)+ has genus zero if and only if p is 2,
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71.
When Ogg heard about the monster group later on, and
noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of
the size of M, he published a paper offering a bottle
of Jack Daniel's whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact.

Congruence
subgroups Γ0(p), for p prime,
are used for defining genus zero surfaces if p−1 divides 24 

The Monster vertex algebra is conjectured (by Edward Frenkel and
collaborators) to be the unique holomorphic 
vertex operator algebra
with charge 24 and partition function j − 744 (where
j is again the modular invariant).

"FINITE DIMENSIONAL HILBERT SPACES ARE COMPLETE FOR
DAGGER COMPACT CLOSED CATEGORIES" PETER SELINGER
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6972.pdf
Abstract. We show that an equation follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed
categories if and only if it holds in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 2.1:
A well-typed equation between morphisms in the language of dagger
compact closed categories follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed categories if and
only if it holds, up to graph isomorphism, in the graphical language.
(See: http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/dagger.pdf )
6. Generalizations
...the results also hold if one replaces k by the ring of Gaussian integers
k = Z[i].
In elementary terms: if a certain equation fails to hold in dagger compact closed
categories, then one can always find a counterexample in matrices with entries of the form
a+bi, where a, b ∈ Z. Moreover, i = √ −1 
can be replaced by √ d for any non-square integer d

    List of subgroups, assuming one fixed pairs of pants decomposition.
    Order 2: Rotation around the midpoint of a short edge interchanges the adjacent
    black and white hexagons; every white hexagon has a black image. There
    are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 3: Cyclic rotation of one pair of pants into itself; cyclic permutation of
    the other pants. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 6: The two symmetries just given combine to the full isotropy group of
    one pair of pants. The decomposition into hexagons by short edges is not
    determined. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: From the construction of the pants we know the cyclic group generated
    by two step translations of a closed geodesic made of short edges. The
    uncolored tiling is preserved. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: The 180◦-rotations around the twelve vertices of our pant hexagons
    form a Klein Four-group that preserves the colored tiling. There are 14 of
    these subgroups.
    Order 8: Extend the cyclic translation subgroup of order 4 by the 180◦ rotation
    around the midpoint of one of the translated short edges. This is the isotropy
    group of an eight step closed geodesic. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 12: The full invariance group of the colored tessellation contains in addition
    to the above Klein group the order 3 rotations of each of the pants.
    There are 14 of these subgroups.
    Order 24: All the above combine to the full invariance group of the uncolored
    tiling, abstractly this is the permutation group S4. There are 14 of these
    subgroups.
    Order 7: We know this as the invariance group of one heptagon. There are 8
    of these subgroups.
    Order 21: The invariance group of the tiling by 14 big triangles; no black and
    white triangles are interchanged; the isotropy of one triangle has order 3.
    There are 8 of these subgroups.

Cauchy's theorem : if a prime p divides |G| then there
is a g in G of order p.
Proof: look at ordered p-tuples of group elements
(g_1,..,g_p) such that 
g_1 g2 ... g_p = 1.
There are |G|^{p-1} such tuples, which is a multple of p
when p divides |G|. 
Consider the action of Z/pZ on these p-tuples.
All the orbits of this action have size 1 or p 
(corresponding to the two subgroups of Z/pZ.)
The fixed points of this action are the constant p-tuples, ie g^p=1.
We have at least one fixed point for example when g=1.
Therefore there must be another fixed point.

from Toby Bartels:
https://plus.google.com/110399830759499718267

A (linear) isometry is precisely a linear operator T that satisfies
$T^* T = I$, while a co-isometry is precisely what
satisfies $T T^* = I$; a unitary operator is thus
precisely whatever is both.  Also, an isometry or co-isometry is
unitary iff it is invertible; thus, since an isometry is
necessary injective, a unitary operator is precisely a surjective isometry;
while a co-isometry is necessarily surjective, so a unitary operator
is precisely an injective co-isometry.

Projection onto a closed subspace is not just a good
example of a co-isometry but in some ways the canonical
example.  To be specific, if T: H -> K is
a co-isometry, then there is a unitary transformation U from K
to the closed subspace (ker T)^⊥ of H, and U
T is projection onto that subspace.  (U itself can be described
by saying that U* is the inclusion of (ker T)^⊥
followed by T, or equivalently that U* is the restriction
of T to (ker T)^⊥.)  Similarly, the canonical example of
an isometry is inclusion of a subspace; if T: H
-> K is an isometry, then there is a unitary
transformation U from H to the subspace im T of
K, and T U* is the inclusion map of this
subspace.  (U itself is T followed by projection onto im
T, or equivalently T with the codomain restricted to im T.)

"MARKOV CHAINS, R-TRIVIAL MONOIDS AND REPRESENTATION THEORY"
ARVIND AYYER, ANNE SCHILLING, BENJAMIN STEINBERG, AND NICOLAS M. THIERY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4250.pdf

A two-sided ideal of a monoid M is a non-empty subset I
such that MIM \subseteq I.
If I, J are ideals then IJ\subseteq I\cap J and so I\cap J is
non-empty.
Therefore every finite monoid has a unique minimal ideal.

Column monomial matrices are exactly the linear operators
induced by set mappings f:X->X.

Lemma 2.2: Every stochastic matrix is a convex combination of column
monomial matrices.

(This is very far from unique!)

Therefore:

Theorem 2.3. Every finite state Markov chain has a random mapping
representation.

Lemma 3.3: If M is a monoid whose minimal ideal b0 is a left zero
semigroup and if π is a probability on M with support contained in
b0, then π ∗ P = π for any probability P on M. In particular, π is
idempotent.

If a group G acts transitively on a set X,
and H is the stabilizer of x∈X, then gHg−1 is
the stabilizer of gx. Thus a normal subgroup has the
property that it leaves one x∈X invariant, then it leaves
every x∈X invariant.

The normalizer of H in G is the stabilizer subgroup of the conjugation
action of G on the set of conjugates of H.

Say your graph has nn nodes. Start out with nn identical 2-sided dice. Each having 0 on both sides will work fine.
Pick an arbitrary edge in the graph, specifying that DaDa should beat DbDb. All the dice currently have kk sides, and satisfy the requirements for previously added edges, and unconnected dice are even*. Find mm, the maximum of all the faces on the dice. To DaDa, add two faces with m+3m+3. To DbDb, add two faces of m+2m+2. To all other dice, add two faces, one of m+1m+1 and one of m+4m+4. Repeat this procedure for all edges in the graph, winding up with 2e+22e+2-sided dice.

When two systems, of which we know the states by
their respective representatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to
known forces between them, and when after a time of
mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no
longer be described in the same way as before, viz.
by endowing each of them with a representative of its
own. I would not call that one but rather the
characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its
entire departure from classical lines of thought.

Grothendieck changed the landscape of mathematics

in the words of Hyman Bass of the University of
Michigan. This viewpoint has been so thoroughly
absorbed into mathematics that nowadays it is difficult
for newcomers to imagine that the field was
not always this way. Grothendieck left his deepest
mark on algebraic geometry, where he placed emphasis
on discovering relationships among mathematical

> the word “decoration” has a near-precise technical meaning in kleinian geometry

this perhaps deserves it's own blog posting, but I am
very curious as to how this works. From what I
can see, there are two (dual) ways of decorating an
object X. One way involves functions *out of* X (colouring
X) and the other way involves functions *into* X (choosing a sub-part of X.)

The Ring of Invariants
----------------------


The ring of symmetric polynomials is finitely
generated (by the elementary symmetric polynomials.)
This ring can be defined as the ring of polynomials
f(x1,...,xn) such that f(p(x)_1,...,p(x)_n) = f(x1,..,xn)
where p is a permutation matrix  (acting on the variables
as basis elements of an n dimensional vector space.)

Generalizing this idea, we can define a ring of polynomials
f^G for any subgroup G of GL(n) as those polynomials fixed
by every element of G.

Questions:
    1. Find a set of generators of f^G. These are the "fundamental invariants."
    2. The relations among the fundamental invariants are called "syzygies."
    3. Write an arbitrary invariant as a polynomial in the fundamental invariants.
    4. Relate geometric properties with invariants and vice-versa.

Complex Reflection group
------------------------

A complex reflection (or pseudoreflection)
of a finite-dimensional complex vector
space V is an element of GL(V) of finite order that fixes
a complex hyperplane pointwise.
A subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections is
a complex reflection group.

All real reflection groups are also complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified
by G. C. Shephard and J. A. Todd (1954). They
found an infinite family G(m,p,n) depending on 3 positive integer
parameters (with p dividing m), and 34 exceptional cases.

Shephard and Todd proved that a finite group acting on 
a complex vector space is a complex reflection group 
if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring 
(Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem).

Truncated Braid Groups
----------------------

Given braid group B_n = <s_1,...,s_n>,
adjoin the relation s_i^k=1, for i=1,..,n.
These are the truncated braid groups B_n(k)

These groups are finite when 1/n + 1/k > 1/2,
for n>2 this corresponds to the five platonic solids.
In this case the order of the group is |1/2 V|^{n-1} n!
where V is the number of vertices of the platonic solid.

When 1/n + 1/k = 1/2 we get a tiling of the complex plane,
and when 1/n + 1/k < 1/2 it's the hyperbolic plane tiled
by regular n-gons with k polygons around each vertex.

These turn out to be complex reflection groups,
with complex reflections given by the s_i.

For algebraic proof of this:
"Factor groups of the braid group" Coxeter, 1957

"""
so the first point i want to emphasize here is that from everything
i've heard about the langlands program, it's supposed to be very
ambitious; thus for example somewhere in the above discussion someone
quotes the following statement from the paper "an elementary
introduction to the langlands program" by stephen gelbart:

"Herein lies the agony as well as the ecstasy of Langlands'
program. To merely state the conjectures requires much of the
machinery of class field theory, the structure theory of algebraic
groups, the representation theory of real and p-adic groups, and (at
least) the language of algebraic geometry. In other words, though the
promised rewards are great, the initiation process is forbidding."

we can turn gelbart's description here into a very rough superficial outline
of what we'd be working on:

1.  the galois-theoretic aspect of number theory (this is roughly what
gelbart means by so-called "class field theory").

2.  lots of kinds of group theory, including especially the study of
group representations of lots of kinds, but from a very
conceptual-geometric viewpoint.

3.  algebraic geometry, but from a very conceptual and
category-theoretic viewpoint unifying algebraic geometry with group
theory and kleinian geometry and mathematical logic.

4.  combining 1, 2, and 3 into the langlands program.

In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to
be more brilliant than I have gone on to become
distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty
five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve
done all things, often beautiful things in a context that
was already set out before them, which they had no
inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained
prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the
universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To
have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in
themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was
mine: The capacity to be alone.

As most of you probably know, the arXiv recently updated
its TeX engine to TexLive2016, and now expects the .bbl
file holding your references to be generated by biblatex in version 2.8.
Unfortunately the biblatex people (or whoever's responsible for that) keep
changing the format of the .bbl file. If you try
to upload an article to the arXiv and get one
of the following errors 'Package keyval Error: family_i undefined.' or 
'Package keyval Error: given_i undefined.',
it might be that you're using an older (and now incompatible) version of biblatex such
as 2.7 (which is e.g. the current version in an
up-to-date ubuntu distribution). A simple fix is to do a
search and replace in your .bbl file, changing every instance
of 'family_i' and 'given_i' to 'familyi' and 'giveni', respectively.
It cost me a good portion of my evening yesterday to
figure that out, so I thought I'd share this here
in case it saves someone some time and nerves.

    and the solution path making the group solvable and thus making the
    quartic formula possible is: b,j,k,e,a.  (that is, each step amounts
    to a color-wheel decoration against the background of the accumulated
    previous decorations.)

From https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Klein+geometry :

"""
Then in (Klein 1872, end of section 5) it says:

    Suppose in space some group or other, the principal group
    for instance, be given. Let us then select a single
    configuration, say a point, or a straight line, or even
    an ellipsoid, etc., and apply to it all the transformations
    of the principal group. We thus obtain an infinite manifoldness
    with a number of dimensions in general equal to the
    number of arbitrary parameters contained in the group, but reducing
    in special cases, namely, when the configuration originally selected has
    the property of being transformed into itself by an infinite
    number of the transformations of the group. Every manifoldness generated
    in this way may be called, with reference to the generating group, a body.

This means in modern language, that if G is
the given group acting on a given space X,
and if S↪X is a given subspace
(a configuration), then the “body” generated by this is the
coset G/StabG(S) of G by the stabilizer subgroup
StabG(X) of that configuration. See also there at Stabilizer
of shapes – Klein geometry.

The text goes on to argue that spaces of this
form G/Stab_G(S) are of fundamental importance:

    If now we desire to base our investigations upon the
    group, selecting at the same time certain definite configurations as
    space-elements, and if we wish to represent uniformly things which
    are of like characteristics, we must evidently choose our space-elements
    in such a way that their manifoldness either is itself
    a body or can be decomposed into bodies.

I've been going through some math books that I bought many years ago and
now I find that I can start to make sense out of their contents.

In particular, John Conway's book "The sensual quadratic form" (1997). In the
first chapter he characterizes integer binary quadratic forms. It looks
to me like he is using an infinite Coxeter group to do this, because
the geometry involved looks like a polygon whose edges form an infinite tree.

It seems the group underlying this is PGL(2, Z), which is the symmetry group of
the two dimensional Z-module (aka lattice.)

Another good book, and full of examples, is "Classical Invariant Theory" by
Peter J. Olver (1999). He seems to be playing much the same game, but this time
over the real or complex field. I'm guessing that this material is the genesis
of algebraic geometry.

Anyway, I'm noticing how these examples are "contravariant" whereas
(so far) the geometric examples of group actions are "covariant". 
By this I mean, in geometric representation theory 
we have been looking at what objects
stay invariant under a group action, whereas in the algebra examples above
the polynomials *do* change under the group action, but we declare that
these are all equivalent polynomials, and then go on to characterize
this equivalence.

These two styles of using group theory really are duals of each other
in the category theory sense of "dual".

Another example of what I'm calling a covariant 
theory is the theory of symmetric functions: these are polynomials
that are *fixed* by a group. I've also been reading a bit about how
this theory is generalized to the other Coxeter groups.
This is explained in chapter 3 of James Humphreys book 
"Reflection Groups And Coxeter Groups", 1990.



Ah! One other very important example of what I am calling a 
"contravariant" theory is the ADE classification of 
simple singularities of a complex analytic function, due to V.I. Arnold.
This I understand very little of, but am quite interested as it relates
to braids and weyl groups and much more.
