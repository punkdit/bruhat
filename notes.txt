    a vector space to any closed (n-1)-dimensional manifold
    a 2-vector space to any closed (n-2)-dimensional manifold
    ...
    an n-vector space assigned to the point.
Also:
    manifolds with boundary corresponds to (higher) linear operators 
    between these (higher) vector spaces.

The cobordism hypothesis states that this entire structure is contained in
the assignment of the n-vector space to the point.

Grothendieck changed the landscape of mathematics

Michigan. This viewpoint has been so thoroughly
absorbed into mathematics that nowadays it is difficult

not always this way. Grothendieck left his deepest

on discovering relationships among mathematical

> the word “decoration” has a near-precise technical meaning in kleinian geometry

this perhaps deserves it's own blog posting, but I am
very curious as to how this works. From what I
can see, there are two (dual) ways of decorating an
object X. One way involves functions *out of* X (colouring
X) and the other way involves functions *into* X (choosing a sub-part of X.)

The Ring of Invariants
----------------------


The ring of symmetric polynomials is finitely
generated (by the elementary symmetric polynomials.)
This ring can be defined as the ring of polynomials
f(x1,...,xn) such that f(p(x)_1,...,p(x)_n) = f(x1,..,xn)
where p is a permutation matrix  (acting on the variables
as basis elements of an n dimensional vector space.)

Generalizing this idea, we can define a ring of polynomials
f^G for any subgroup G of GL(n) as those polynomials fixed
by every element of G.

Questions:
    1. Find a set of generators of f^G. These are the "fundamental invariants."
    2. The relations among the fundamental invariants are called "syzygies."
    3. Write an arbitrary invariant as a polynomial in the fundamental invariants.
    4. Relate geometric properties with invariants and vice-versa.

Complex Reflection group
------------------------

A complex reflection (or pseudoreflection)
of a finite-dimensional complex vector
space V is an element of GL(V) of finite order that fixes
a complex hyperplane pointwise.
A subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections is
a complex reflection group.

All real reflection groups are also complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified
by G. C. Shephard and J. A. Todd (1954). They
found an infinite family G(m,p,n) depending on 3 positive integer
parameters (with p dividing m), and 34 exceptional cases.

Shephard and Todd proved that a finite group acting on 
a complex vector space is a complex reflection group 
if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring 
(Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem).

Truncated Braid Groups
----------------------

Given braid group B_n = <s_1,...,s_n>,
adjoin the relation s_i^k=1, for i=1,..,n.
These are the truncated braid groups B_n(k)

These groups are finite when 1/n + 1/k > 1/2,
for n>2 this corresponds to the five platonic solids.
In this case the order of the group is |1/2 V|^{n-1} n!
where V is the number of vertices of the platonic solid.

When 1/n + 1/k = 1/2 we get a tiling of the complex plane,
and when 1/n + 1/k < 1/2 it's the hyperbolic plane tiled
by regular n-gons with k polygons around each vertex.

These turn out to be complex reflection groups,
with complex reflections given by the s_i.

For algebraic proof of this:
"Factor groups of the braid group" Coxeter, 1957

"""
so the first point i want to emphasize here is that from everything
i've heard about the langlands program, it's supposed to be very
ambitious; thus for example somewhere in the above discussion someone
quotes the following statement from the paper "an elementary
introduction to the langlands program" by stephen gelbart:

"Herein lies the agony as well as the ecstasy of Langlands'
program. To merely state the conjectures requires much of the
machinery of class field theory, the structure theory of algebraic
groups, the representation theory of real and p-adic groups, and (at
least) the language of algebraic geometry. In other words, though the
promised rewards are great, the initiation process is forbidding."

we can turn gelbart's description here into a very rough superficial outline
of what we'd be working on:

1.  the galois-theoretic aspect of number theory (this is roughly what
gelbart means by so-called "class field theory").

2.  lots of kinds of group theory, including especially the study of
group representations of lots of kinds, but from a very
conceptual-geometric viewpoint.

3.  algebraic geometry, but from a very conceptual and
category-theoretic viewpoint unifying algebraic geometry with group
theory and kleinian geometry and mathematical logic.

4.  combining 1, 2, and 3 into the langlands program.

In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to
be more brilliant than I have gone on to become
distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty
five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve
done all things, often beautiful things in a context that
was already set out before them, which they had no
inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained
prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the
universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To
have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in
themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was
mine: The capacity to be alone.

As most of you probably know, the arXiv recently updated
its TeX engine to TexLive2016, and now expects the .bbl
file holding your references to be generated by biblatex in version 2.8.
Unfortunately the biblatex people (or whoever's responsible for that) keep
changing the format of the .bbl file. If you try
to upload an article to the arXiv and get one
of the following errors 'Package keyval Error: family_i undefined.' or 
'Package keyval Error: given_i undefined.',
it might be that you're using an older (and now incompatible) version of biblatex such
as 2.7 (which is e.g. the current version in an
up-to-date ubuntu distribution). A simple fix is to do a
search and replace in your .bbl file, changing every instance
of 'family_i' and 'given_i' to 'familyi' and 'giveni', respectively.
It cost me a good portion of my evening yesterday to
figure that out, so I thought I'd share this here
in case it saves someone some time and nerves.

James: 
    and the solution path making the group solvable and thus making the
    quartic formula possible is: b,j,k,e,a.  (that is, each step amounts
    to a color-wheel decoration against the background of the accumulated
    previous decorations.)


subgroup I has "4 choose 2 == 6" conjugate subgroups

"""
Then in (Klein 1872, end of section 5) it says:

    Suppose in space some group or other, the principal group
    for instance, be given. Let us then select a single
    configuration, say a point, or a straight line, or even
    an ellipsoid, etc., and apply to it all the transformations
    of the principal group. We thus obtain an infinite manifoldness
    with a number of dimensions in general equal to the
    number of arbitrary parameters contained in the group, but reducing
    in special cases, namely, when the configuration originally selected has
    the property of being transformed into itself by an infinite
    number of the transformations of the group. Every manifoldness generated
    in this way may be called, with reference to the generating group, a body.

This means in modern language, that if G is
the given group acting on a given space X,
and if S↪X is a given subspace
(a configuration), then the “body” generated by this is the
coset G/StabG(S) of G by the stabilizer subgroup
StabG(X) of that configuration. See also there at Stabilizer
of shapes – Klein geometry.

The text goes on to argue that spaces of this
form G/Stab_G(S) are of fundamental importance:

    If now we desire to base our investigations upon the
    group, selecting at the same time certain definite configurations as
    space-elements, and if we wish to represent uniformly things which
    are of like characteristics, we must evidently choose our space-elements
    in such a way that their manifoldness either is itself
    a body or can be decomposed into bodies.

I've been going through some math books that I bought many years ago and
now I find that I can start to make sense out of their contents.

In particular, John Conway's book "The sensual quadratic form" (1997). In the
first chapter he characterizes integer binary quadratic forms. It looks
to me like he is using an infinite Coxeter group to do this, because
the geometry involved looks like a polygon whose edges form an infinite tree.

It seems the group underlying this is PGL(2, Z), which is the symmetry group of
the two dimensional Z-module (aka lattice.)

Another good book, and full of examples, is "Classical Invariant Theory" by
Peter J. Olver (1999). He seems to be playing much the same game, but this time
over the real or complex field. I'm guessing that this material is the genesis
of algebraic geometry.

Anyway, I'm noticing how these examples are "contravariant" whereas
(so far) the geometric examples of group actions are "covariant". 
By this I mean, in geometric representation theory 
we have been looking at what objects
stay invariant under a group action, whereas in the algebra examples above
the polynomials *do* change under the group action, but we declare that
these are all equivalent polynomials, and then go on to characterize
this equivalence.

These two styles of using group theory really are duals of each other
in the category theory sense of "dual".

Another example of what I'm calling a covariant 
theory is the theory of symmetric functions: these are polynomials
that are *fixed* by a group. I've also been reading a bit about how
this theory is generalized to the other Coxeter groups.
This is explained in chapter 3 of James Humphreys book 
"Reflection Groups And Coxeter Groups", 1990.



Ah! One other very important example of what I am calling a 
"contravariant" theory is the ADE classification of 
simple singularities of a complex analytic function, due to V.I. Arnold.
This I understand very little of, but am quite interested as it relates
to braids and weyl groups and much more.
