Table of marks
The element in row G/K and column H represents the number
of points in the orbit (type) G/K fixed by H. By the
definition of the action of G on G/K, a coset gK is fixed
by H whenever HgK = gK. But this is equivalent to, g-1Hg
< K so that
m(G/K,H)=#{gK∈G/K∣g−1Hg<K}.
In particular, the diagonal elements are m(K, K) = |NG(K)/K|.
If H is not conjugate to a subgroup of K then m(G/K, H) = 0.
If K is a normal subgroup of G and H < K then g−1Hg⊂K for all g∈G, so that m(G/K,H)=|G/K|.
If G is Abelian then every subgroup is normal and so, again if H < K then m(G/K,H)=|G/K|, otherwise m(G/K,H)=0.

    Category theory is the theory of duality.
    
    Duality is of course an ancient notion in philosophy.
    At least as a term, it makes a curious re-appearance
    in the conjectural theory of fundamental physics formerly
    known as string theory as duality in string theory. In
    both cases, the literature left some room in delineating
    what precisely is meant. But the philosophically inclined
    mathematician could notice (see Lambek 82) that an excellent
    candidate to make precise the idea of duality is the
    mathematical concept of adjunction, from category theory.

    Historically, category theory was introduced in order
    to make precise the concept of natural transformation:
    The concept of functors was introduced just so as to
    support that of natural transformations, and the concept
    of categories only served that of functors (see e.g.
    Freyd 65, Part II).
    
    But natural transformations are, in turn, exactly the
    basis for the concept of adjoint functors (Def. 1.32
    below), equivalently adjunctions between categories (Prop.
    1.39 below), shown on the left. All universal constructions,
    the heart of category theory, are special cases of adjoint
    functors – hence of dualities, if we follow Lambek 82:
    This includes the concepts of limits and colimits (Def.
    3.1 below), ends and coends (Def. 3.13 below) Kan extensions
    (Prop. 3.29 below), and the behaviour of these constructions,
    such as for instance the free co-completion nature of
    the Yoneda embedding (Prop. 3.20 below).

    The pivotal role of adjunctions in category theory (Lawvere
    08) and in the foundations of mathematics (Lawvere 69,
    Lawvere 94 ) was particularly amplified by F. W. Lawvere1.
    Moreover, Lawvere saw the future of category theory (Lawvere
    91) as concerned with adjunctions expressing systems
    of archetypical dualities that reveal foundations for
    geometry (Lawvere 07) and physics (Lawvere 97, see Def.
    5.2 and Def. 5.10 below). He suggested (Lawvere 94) this
    as a precise formulation of core aspects of the theory
    of everything of early 19th century philosophy: Hegel‘s
    Science of Logic.
    

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/objective+and+subjective+logic
    Lawvere 92: It is my belief that in the next decade and
    in the next century the technical advances forged by
    category theorists will be of value to dialectical philosophy,
    lending precise form with disputable mathematical models
    to ancient philosophical distinctions such as general
    vs. particular, objective vs. subjective, being vs. becoming,
    space vs. quantity, equality vs. difference, quantitative
    vs. qualitative etc. In turn the explicit attention by
    mathematicians to such philosophical questions is necessary
    to achieve the goal of making mathematics (and hence
    other sciences) more widely learnable and useable. Of
    course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics
    and that mathematicians learn philosophy.

Axiomatic Method and Category Theory
Andrei Rodin
(Submitted on 25 Sep 2012)
Lawvere's axiomatization of topos theory and Voevodsky's
axiomatization of heigher homotopy theory exemplify a
new way of axiomatic theory building, which goes beyond
the classical Hibert-style Axiomatic Method. The new
notion of Axiomatic Method that emerges in Categorical
logic opens new possibilities for using this method in
physics and other natural sciences.

    The second area is the Langlands program. Unlike the
    Riemann hypothesis, the Langlands program is named for
    the most advanced part of the theory, not the original
    question. But the roots of the Langlands program go all
    the way back to Gauss' Law of Quadratic Reciprocity:
    Given an odd prime q, let ϵ=±1 so that ϵq≡1mod4.
    Then for an odd prime p, the Legendre symbols (p|q)
    and (ϵq|p) are equal. More abstractly, the Galois
    representation arising from the Kronecker symbol (ϵq|∗)
    has the same L function as the Dirichlet character (∗|q).
    Langlands interprets the latter as an automorphic from
    on GL(1).

    You're certainly used to Bruhat-Tits theory for SL2SL2,
    or at least for PGL2PGL2, over QpQp, where one encounters
    the (p+1)(p+1)-regular tree. As you know, PGL2(Qp)PGL2(Qp)
    acts on this tree, and the stabilizer of a point is a
    maximal compact subgroup that is conjugate to PGL2(Zp)PGL2(Zp),
    and the stabilizer of an edge is an Iwahori subgroup.
    This I assume is a familiar picture.

    there are a number of astonishing results in the book, and
    perhaps this is a good place to mention some of the most miraculous.
    - The occurrence of the Leech lattice as the unique laminated lattice in
    24 dimensions (Fig. 6.1).
    - Gleason's theorem describing the weight enumerators of doubly-even
    self-dual codes, and Hecke's theorem describing the theta series of even
    unimodular lattices (Theorems 16 and 17 of Chap. 7).
    - The one-to-one correspondence between the 23 deep holes in the Leech
    lattice and the even unimodular 24-dimensional lattices of minimal norm 2
    (Chapters 16,23,26).
    - The construction of the Leech lattice in 11 25 ,1 as wJ../w , where
        w = (0,1,2,3 .. " .24170)
    is a vector of zero norm (Theorem 3 of Chap. 26). (We remind the reader
    that in Lorentzian space R 25 ,1, which is 26-dimensional space equipped
    with the norm x'x=xr+'" +Xi5-xi6, there is a unique even
    unimodular lattice 11 25 • 1 - see §1 of Chap. 26.)
    - The occurrence of the Leech lattice as the Coxeter diagram of the
    reflections in the automorphism group of 11 25 •1 (Chap. 27).

the big galois group Gal(Q¯/Q) acts on the
l-power torsion points of an elliptic curve over Q for
some prime l, and defines a representation in a natural way. 

For an elliptic curve over Q,
serre's mod l representation is
    Gal(Q¯/Q) -> Aut(E_l) = GL(2, l)
where E_l is the group of l-torsion points on E.

    to non-abelian field extensions, you will require higher
    dimensional Galois representations and Artin LL functions.
    
    (Maass 1949) Maass wave forms of eigenvalue 1/41/4 correspond
    to 2-dimensional Galois representations, see Bump "Autom.reps...."
    Chapter 1.9. Similar things happen for modular forms
    of weight one (Hecke 1925). In general, automorphic representations
    and Galois representations are expected to be in a certain
    correspondence (the LL functions and the root numbers
    should be the same).
    
    A possible conceptual explanation for the importance
    of Galois representations delivers the Tannaka-Krein
    theorem. Roughly, this states that knowing the representation
    theory is equivalent to knowing the group. The group
    you want to understand is the absolute Galois groups
    (with a profinite topology) via its Galois representations,
    and understand the Galois representation via automorphic forms.
    
    Perhaps one famous example is the Taniyama Shimura conjecture
    and consequently Fermat's last theorem: A certain construction
    with the elliptic curve gave a Galois representation,
    and the later was then shown to correspond to an automorphic form.

Exceptional mathematics: data structure or algorithm?


-----------------------------

A linear cyclic q-ary code is an ideal in the
ring of polynomials over GF(q) modulo x^n-1.
Therefore: this ideal is principle, and every
codeword is a multiple of some generator polynomial.
This generator polynomial is the monic codeword of least degree,
and it is a divisor of x^n-1.

QUASIALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE OCTONIONS
Other examples include the higher 2^n-onion Cayley algebras
and examples associated to Hadamard matrices.
...for the octonions, the cocycle is a coboundary and can
be identified as the result of twisting k(G) by
a 2-cochain F. In an extension of Drinfeld’s theory of
twisting or ‘gauge equivalence’[1], any algebra
on which k(G) acts also has to be twisted to remain a
module-algebra. In this sense the octonions
are gauge-equivalent or the twisting of the group algebra
of Z2×Z2×Z2 by a 2-cochain, which we provide.

Matrix Representation of Octonions and Generalizations
J Daboul, R Delbourgo
(Submitted on 9 Jun 1999)
We define a special matrix multiplication among a special
subset of $2N\x 2N$ matrices, and study the resulting
(non-associative) algebras and their subalgebras. We
derive the conditions under which these algebras become
alternative non-associative and when they become associative.
In particular, these algebras yield special matrix representations
of octonions and complex numbers; they naturally lead
to the Cayley-Dickson doubling process. Our matrix representation
of octonions also yields elegant insights into Dirac's
equation for a free particle. A few other results and
remarks arise as byproducts.

    In the pictures I drew above, my elementary defects were
    the the vortex, with charge +1, and the antivortex with
    charge -1. But I can change what my elementary defects
    look like by making a gauge transformation. If I rotate
    all spins by 180 degrees, then I just change the signs
    of the two defects. But if I rotate all spins by 90 degrees,
    then the vortex looks like an electric charge, with field
    lines pointing radially (either inward or outward). The
    antivortex still looks qualitatively the same, buts its
    axes are redefined.
    
    So in some descriptions, the fundamental defects of the
    XY model don’t contain vortices at all, but only radial
    charges and “antivortices” of the sort that I drew. (This
    is the way it’s presented, for example, in Kardar’s book
    on the statistical mechanics of fields.)
    
    In that sense, the basic symmetry between clockwise vortices
    and counterclockwise vortices is a gauge symmetry. What
    you want your +1 defects and -1 defects to look like
    is your choice.

    algorithms still struggle with today.
    
    “This works both ways around,” Veale told me in an email.
    “Cock (a bird) and Dick (the given name) are both harmless

"How the hippies saved physics"
From the CODA:
    And yet a topic whose importance strikes so many physicists
    today as self-evident had been shunned for a full decade
    after Bell’s original publication, castigated as less
    than “real” physics. 

    ...
    Their concern, instead, was to broaden the physicists’
    range of approaches or methods beyond the hyperpragmatism
    that had marked the earlier Cold War years. They strove
    to expand the physics profession’s collective mental
    space, to push beyond what they considered a narrowness
    of vision that had hardened after a quarter century of
    instrumentalist thinking....
    
    But that practical, pragmatic mindset had blinded nearly
    the entire discipline to major breakthroughs like Bell’s
    theorem.

"The age of entanglement"
Louisa Gilder
p271
    Three months later, on October 1, 1990, Bell died of
    a stroke in his kitchen in Geneva, so sud- denly
    and unexpectedly that Bertlmann couldn’t even come to
    the funeral. He was only sixty- two,
    never having given anyone except Mary a hint of the terrible
    migraine headaches that he had suffered from all his life.
    In the year of his death, Bell’s theorem was still a piece
    of arcana, a vaguely suspect subject with roots
    in unloved corners of the subculture of quantum physics.
    A decade later, it would be the principal
    subject of whole issues of Physics Review Letters, and
    universities would be hurrying to create
    special labs entirely for the study of subjects made possible
    by Bell’s theorem. For those who now work
    in these newly wide-open fields, it is a frustrating
    and poignant irony that, if only Bell could have
    lived out his biblically allotted three-score years and
    ten, he would have seen such wonderful things
    begun by his half-secret hobby.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/26755/what-if-anything-makes-homogeneous-polynomials-so-great
    I would rephrase the question as "what is so great about
    projective space (as compared to affine space)?" I would
    give two answers:
    Projective space has a larger symmetry group: dimension
    n2+2nn2+2n rather than n2+nn2+n.
    Projective space is compact.
    The first is what you are using when you turn x2+y2=1x2+y2=1
    into x2+y2=z2x2+y2=z2 and then (z+y)(z−y)=1(z+y)(z−y)=1;
    the corresponding change of coordinates is a symmetry
    of projective space which doesn't pass to affine space.
    The second is why homogenous polynomials work better
    for intersection theory: intersections can't run off
    to infinity. It is also why point counting over finite
    fields gives nicer answers in projective space: point
    counting is related to cohomology, and cohomology for
    smooth compact spaces obeys Poincare duality.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/62820/pythagorean-5-tuples
    In the early 90s, I took a class from Victor Kac and
    in it, he explained a very beautiful way of generating
    all the primitive solutions for the Pythagorean equation
    for a sum of n−1n−1 perfect squares is equal to a perfect
    square where nn can be 3, 4, 5, ..., 10. Unfortunately,
    I do not know where in the literature this is described
    in detail. It might be in his Infinite Dimensional Lie
    Algebras book, but I don't know.
    
    The idea is to realize the solutions as the isotropic
    roots for a certain root system.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/272982/how-do-we-construct-the-g%C3%B6del-s-sentence-in-martin-l%C3%B6f-type-theory
    There is a generalization of Gödel's incompleteness theorem
    that is more naturally applicable to MLTT: Löb's theorem
    says that to prove P, it suffices to prove that P is
    true whenever P is provable. Symbolically, using ◻P
    to mean "P is provable", this is
        ◻(◻P→P)→◻P
    If you instantiate P with a contradiction (say, 1=0
    or ⊥), you get Gödel's incompleteness theorem:
        ◻(◻⊥→⊥)→◻⊥
    or, using the fact that ¬A is A→⊥,
        ◻(¬◻⊥)→◻⊥
    If your theory is consistent, i.e., if ◻P→P, then this becomes
        ¬◻(¬◻⊥)
    or "you cannot prove that there is no prove of false".
    In the standard phrasing of Gödel's incompleteness theorem,
    this would be "the statement 'there is no proof of false'
    is true, but unprovable".
    
    While formalizing theorems and proofs using natural numbers
    is standard in set theory, in MLTT, it's much more natural
    to formulate provability by giving an inductive type
    of theorems (also called types), and an inductive type
    of proofs (also called terms).

Parameters of Integral Circulant Graphs and Periodic Quantum Dynamics
Nitin Saxena, Simone Severini, Igor Shparlinski
    The intention of the paper is to move a step towards
    a classification of network topologies that exhibit periodic
    quantum dynamics. We show that the evolution of a quantum
    system, whose hamiltonian is identical to the adjacency
    matrix of a circulant graph, is periodic if and only
    if all eigenvalues of the graph are integers (that is,
    the graph is integral). Motivated by this observation,
    we focus on relevant properties of integral circulant
    graphs. Specifically, we bound the number of vertices
    of integral circulant graphs in terms of their degree,
    characterize bipartiteness and give exact bounds for
    their diameter. Additionally, we prove that circulant
    graphs with odd order do not allow perfect state transfer.

Periodic Graphs
Chris Godsil
    We extend previous work by showing that a regular graph
    with at least four distinct eigenvalues is periodic with
    respect to some vertex if and only if its eigenvalues
    are integers.

    The legendre symbol (a|m) is defined as the sign of the
    permutation "multiplication by a mod m". This happens
    to match up with the usual definition. (Note the Cayley
    type replacement of 'a' with the function 'multiplication by a').

TARA E. BRENDLE AND DAN MARGALIT
Abstract. By evaluating the Burau representation at t = −1, we obtain
a symplectic representation of the braid group. We study the resulting
congruence subgroups of the braid group, namely, the preimages of
the principal congruence subgroups of the symplectic group. Our main
result is that the level 4 congruence subgroup is equal to the group generated
by squares of Dehn twists. We also show that the image of the
Brunnian subgroup of the braid group under the symplectic representation
is the level four congruence subgroup.

The Peterson Graph can be obtained by identifying the
antipodal points of a dodecahedron and it has S5 as
its automorphism group

Possibly the most natural way to see the action of S5
is to identify the 10 vertices with (5 choose 2) pairs
and say two pairs are adjacent iff they're disjoint. 

The Peterson graph has a nice description in terms of
the 4 points and 6 edges of a tetrahedron or PG(3,1)
if we abuse notation. The Moore graph of order 7 has
a nice description in terms of the 15 points and 35 lines
of PG(3,2). Now, PG(3,7) has 400 points and 2850 lines
and if there is a Moore graph of order 57 (warning! warning!
Many would conjecture that there is none!) then it has
400+2850 vertices of which at most 400 could be independent...
The fact that a large automorphism group has been ruled
out makes this an unpromising approach, but who knows?

David Bohm, Quantum Mechanics and Enlightenment

    Someday, science and art will merge, Bohm predicted.
    “This division of art and science is temporary,” he observed.
    “It didn't exist in the past, and there’s no reason why
    it should go on in the future.” Just as art consists
    not simply of works of art but of an “attitude, the artistic
    spirit,” so does science consist not in the accumulation
    of knowledge but in the creation of fresh modes of perception.
    “The ability to perceive or think differently is more
    important than the knowledge gained,” Bohm explained.

Between classical and quantum
N.P. Landsman
https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506082
    The relationship between classical and quantum theory
    is of central importance to the philosophy of physics,
    and any interpretation of quantum mechanics has to clarify
    it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly historical
    and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically
    rigorous, including over 500 references. On the assumption
    that quantum mechanics is universal and complete, we
    discuss three ways in which classical physics has so
    far been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely
    in the limit h -> 0 of small Planck's constant (in a
    finite system), in the limit of a large system, and through
    decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit
    is closely related to modern quantization theory and
    microlocal analysis, whereas the second involves methods
    of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection sectors
    and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical
    world does not emerge as a sharply defined objective
    reality, but rather as an approximate appearance relative
    to certain "classical" states and observables. Decoherence
    subsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that
    they are "einselected", i.e. robust against coupling
    to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of classical
    observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically
    define (approximately) consistent sets of histories.
    We make the point that classicality results from the
    elimination of certain states and observables from quantum
    theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation
    (as Heisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack
    of it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%27s_representation_theorem_for_Boolean_algebras
Each Boolean algebra B has an associated topological
space, denoted here S(B), called its Stone space. The
points in S(B) are the ultrafilters on B, or equivalently
the homomorphisms from B to the two-element Boolean algebra. 

For every Boolean algebra B, S(B) is a compact totally
disconnected Hausdorff space; such spaces are called
Stone spaces (also profinite spaces). Conversely, given
any topological space X, the collection of subsets of
X that are clopen (both closed and open) is a Boolean algebra.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification
The Stone–Čech compactification βX is a compact Hausdorff
space together with a continuous map from X that has
the following universal property: any continuous map
f: X → K, where K is a compact Hausdorff space, extends
uniquely to a continuous map βf: βX → K.

this universal property, together with the fact that
βX is a compact Hausdorff space containing X, characterizes
βX up to homeomorphism.

if X is discrete, one can construct βX as the set of
all ultrafilters on X, with a topology known as Stone
topology. The elements of X correspond to the principal
ultrafilters.

The Stone–Čech compactification is naturally homeomorphic
to the spectrum of Cb(X).[3] Here Cb(X) denotes the C*-algebra
of all continuous bounded functions on X with sup-norm.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/223584/which-philosophy-for-reductive-groups
    The early decades of the theory of automorphic forms
    exhibited an abundance of similar-looking features, such
    as for Hilbert modular forms, Siegel modular forms, theta-series
    in the study of quadratic forms, and so on. But how to
    unify these into a single framework, treat both Maass
    forms and holomorphic forms on equal footing, understand
    the significance of Eisenstein series, etc.? It is precisely
    the unified perspective on the internal structure of
    all reductive groups and the analogous unification for
    the representation theory in Harish-Chandra's work that
    makes them an ideal framework for subsuming all such
    considerations into a uniform group-theoretic framework.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/27164/why-is-fourier-analysis-so-handy-for-proving-the-isoperimetric-inequality
    Experience with Fourier analysis and representation theory
    has shown that every time a problem is invariant with
    respect to a group symmetry, the representation theory
    of that group is likely to be relevant. If the group
    is abelian, the representation theory is given by the
    Fourier transform on that group.
    
    In this case, the relevant symmetry group is that of
    reparameterising the arclength parameterisation of the
    perimeter by translation. This operation does not change
    the area or the perimeter. When combined with the observation
    (from Stokes theorem) that both the area and perimeter
    of a body can be easily recovered from the arclength
    parameterisation, this naturally suggests to use Fourier
    analysis in the arclength variable.


https://mathoverflow.net/questions/243518/linear-algebra-in-terms-of-abstract-nonsense
    To my mind there are two classes of interesting categorical
    facts here, loosely speaking "additive" facts and "multiplicative"
    facts. Some additive facts:
    
    Finite-dimensional vector spaces over kk has biproducts,
    and every object is a finite biproduct of copies of a
    single object, namely kk. The categories with this property
    are precisely the categories of finite rank free modules
    over a semiring RR (the endomorphisms of the single object).
    These biproduct decompositions encapsulate both the idea
    that vector spaces have bases and that a choice of bases
    can be used to write linear maps as matrices.
    
    The single object kk above is simple, and so every object
    is a finite biproduct of simple objects. The categories
    with this property, in addition to 1, are precisely the
    categories of finite rank free modules over a division
    semiring RR.

Loop series for discrete statistical models on graphs
Michael Chertkov, Vladimir Y. Chernyak
    https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0603189
    In this paper we present derivation details, logic, and
    motivation for the loop calculus introduced in \cite{06CCa}.
    Generating functions for three inter-related discrete
    statistical models are each expressed in terms of a finite
    series. The first term in the series corresponds to the
    Bethe-Peierls (Belief Propagation)-BP contribution, the
    other terms are labeled by loops on the factor graph.
    All loop contributions are simple rational functions
    of spin correlation functions calculated within the BP
    approach. We discuss two alternative derivations of the
    loop series. One approach implements a set of local auxiliary
    integrations over continuous fields with the BP contribution
    corresponding to an integrand saddle-point value. The
    integrals are replaced by sums in the complimentary approach,
    briefly explained in \cite{06CCa}. A local gauge symmetry
    transformation that clarifies an important invariant
    feature of the BP solution, is revealed in both approaches.
    The partition function remains invariant while individual
    terms change under the gauge transformation. The requirement
    for all individual terms to be non-zero only for closed
    loops in the factor graph (as opposed to paths with loose
    ends) is equivalent to fixing the first term in the series
    to be exactly equal to the BP contribution. Further applications
    of the loop calculus to problems in statistical physics,
    computer and information sciences are discussed.

Generic emergence of classical features in quantum Darwinism

     emergence of classicality is a general feature of any

    who acquire information about a quantum system indirectly
    have access at most to classical
    information about one and the same measurement of the
    quantum system; moreover, if
    such information is available to many observers, they
    necessarily agree.

What is quantum in quantum randomness?
Philippe Grangier1 and Alexia Auff`eves2
    It is often said that quantum and classical randomness
    are of different nature, the former being
    ontological and the latter epistemological. However,
    so far the question of ”What is quantum in
    quantum randomness”, i.e. what is the impact of quantization
    and discreteness on the nature of
    randomness, remains to answer. In a first part, we explicit
    the differences between quantum and
    classical randomness within a recently proposed ontology
    for quantum mechanics based on contextual
    objectivity. In this view, quantum randomness is the
    result of contextuality and quantization.
    We show that this approach strongly impacts the purposes
    of quantum theory as well as its areas of
    application. In particular, it challenges current programs
    inspired by classical reductionism, aiming
    at the emergence of the classical world from a large
    number of quantum systems. In a second part,
    we analyze quantum physics and thermodynamics as theories
    of randomness, unveiling their mutual
    influences. We finally consider new technological applications
    of quantum randomness opened in
    the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.

Sequential Measurement Characterises Quantum Theory
John van de Wetering∗
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11139.pdf
    We study general physical systems with a notion of sequential
    measurement that satisfies a few simple
    and intuitive conditions. We show that, apart from two
    exceptional cases, the systems satisfying
    these conditions are exactly the real, complex or quaternionic
    quantum systems. Moreover, only the
    complex quantum systems remain if systems must be allowed
    to be composed together in a locally
    tomographic manner. In other words, quantum theory is
    the unique locally tomographic theory
    allowing sequential measurement.


Uniqueness of Composition in Quantum Theory and Linguistics
Coecke et al
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00708.pdf
    We derive a uniqueness result for non-Cartesian composition
    of systems in a large class of process
    theories, with important implications for quantum theory
    and linguistics. Specifically, we consider
    theories of wavefunctions valued in commutative involutive
    semirings—as modelled by categories
    of free finite-dimensional modules—and we prove that
    the only bilinear compact-closed symmetric
    monoidal structure is the canonical one (up to linear
    monoidal equivalence). Our results apply
    to conventional quantum theory and other toy theories
    of interest in the literature, such as real
    quantum theory, relational quantum theory, hyperbolic
    quantum theory and modal quantum theory. In
    computational linguistics they imply that linear models
    for categorical compositional distributional
    semantics (DisCoCat)—such as vector spaces, sets and
    relations, and sets and histograms—admit an
    (essentially) unique compatible pregroup grammar

AMBIGUITY THEORY, OLD AND NEW
YVES ANDRE
Abstract. This is a introductory survey of some recent developments of “Galois
ideas” in Arithmetic, Complex Analysis, Transcendental Number Theory
and Quantum Field Theory, and of some of their interrelations.
    Ambiguity theory was the name which Galois used when he referred to his
    own theory and its future developments. For instance,
    in his celebrated last letter
    (1832), he wrote:
        My principal meditations for some time have been directed
        towards the application of the theory of ambiguity to
        transcendental analysis. It was a question of seeing
        a priori in a relation between quantities or transcendent
        functions, what exchanges one could make, which quantities
        one could substitute for the given quantities without
        the original relation ceasing to hold. That immediately
        made clear the impossibility of finding many expressions
        that one could look for. But I do not have time and my
        ideas are not yet well developed on this ground which
        is immense.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2704/links-between-riemann-surfaces-and-algebraic-geometry
    Every Riemann surface is a complex algebraic curve and
    every compact complex algebraic curve can be embedded
    into a projective plane and drawn as the Riemann surface.
    
    There are lots of gems in this short statement. For example,
    as I said there is a way to count the algebraic forms
    in terms of inner geometry of algebraic curve. This gives
    some number, which could be 0, 1, 2, etc. On the other
    hand, if you draw a Riemann surface, you notice that
    it can be studied in topology and then it has the invariant
    called the number of handles which could also be 0 (sphere),
    1 (torus), 2, etc. It turns out this is exactly the same
    thing though defined in a completely different way by
    a completely different branch of mathematics.
    
    The whole algebraic geometry is, so to say, our attempt
    to make ourselves comfortable about this amazing connection
    between things we calculate (algebra) and things we draw
    (geometry).

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/63320/where-do-surreal-numbers-come-from-and-what-do-they-mean
    Not numbers exactly, but certainly Conway's games (and
    related game-like structures) have aroused plenty of
    interest in certain category theorists and logicians,
    as they can be used to give categorical (non-posetal)
    semantics for substructural logics. In other words, under
    the Curry-Howard paradigm of "propositions as types",
    where propositions are promoted to objects and proofs
    of propositions p⇒qp⇒q are promoted to morphisms p→qp→q,
    the structures of formal deductions are embedded in strategies
    for games.
    
    It was originally observed by André Joyal that Conway
    games are the objects of a compact closed category, where
    morphisms between games G→HG→H are second-player winning
    strategies for −G+H−G+H.

    If we make no prior assumptions, then we have no ground
    to stand on. The quicksand of radical and unbounded doubt
    opens beneath our feet and we sink, unable to gain purchase.
    We remain forever at the base of the sheer rock face
    of the world, unable to begin our climb. Yet, while we
    must start with prior knowledge we take as true, we must
    also remain open to surprise; else we can never learn
    anything new. In this sense, science is always Janus-headed,
    like the ancient Roman god of liminal spaces, looking
    simultaneously to the past and to the future. Learning
    is essentially about updating our biases, not eliminating
    them. We always need them to get started, but we also
    need them to be open to change, otherwise we would be
    unable to exploit the new vistas that our advancing technology
    opens to view.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/37214/why-arent-there-more-classifying-spaces-in-number-theory
    Classifying spaces are widely used in algebraic number
    theory, but in slightly disguised form. A classifying
    space is really just an approximation to the classifying
    topos of a group. However the classifying topos is just
    the category of G-sets, which is exactly what one uses
    in defining group cohomology and so on. Or to put it
    another way, all the useful information in the classifying
    space is already contained in the category of G-sets.
    
    The comment at the end of the question is correct: group
    cohomology was discovered as the cohomology of the classifying
    space, and the topological constructions were then turned
    into algebraic constructions and removed from the theory.
    So in some sense all the group cohomology calculations
    are implicitly using the classifying space.


https://mathoverflow.net/a/12382/39775
    So we obtain a description of the set of primes that
    split in KK in terms of the modular form f(q)f(q), or
    more precisely its Hecke eigenvalues (or what amounts
    to the same thing, its qq-expansion).
    The Langlands program asserts that an analogous statement
    is true for any Galois extension of number fields E/FE/F
    when one is given a continuous representation Gal(E/F)↪GL_n(C).

    Let g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with an ordered

    modulo the relations (xixj−xjxi=[xi,xj]).
    
    The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem states that U(g)
    has a basis consisting of lexicographically ordered monomials
    i.e. monomials of the form x1^e1x2^e2...xn^en.
    Checking that this basis spans U(g) is trivial, so
    the work lies in showing that these monomials are linearly independent.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/570/deformation-theory-of-representations-of-an-algebraic-group
    For an algebraic group G and a representation V, I think
    it's a standard result (but I don't have a reference) that
    (.) the obstruction to deforming V as a representation of
        G is an element of H2(G,V⊗V*)
    (.) if the obstruction is zero, isomorphism classes of deformations
        are parameterized by H1(G,V⊗V*)
    (.) automorphisms of a given deformation (as a deformation
        of V; i.e. restricting to the identity modulo your square-zero
        ideal) are parameterized by H0(G,V⊗V*)

    where the Hi refer to standard group cohomology (derived
    functors of invariants). The analogous statement, where
    the algebraic group G is replaced by a Lie algebra g
    and group cohomology is replaced by Lie algebra cohomology,
    is true, but the only proof I know is a big calculation.

    Assume G acts strongly transitively on a thick building
    Δ. Let B be the stabilizer of the fundamental chamber,
    N the stabilizer of the fundamental apartment, T the
    subgroup fixing the fundamental apartment, and W the
    quotient N/T. Then (G,B,N) is a BN-pair,
    also called a Tits system, for G. In particular, you
    have the Bruhat decomposition G=∐w∈WBwB, plus
    lots more.
    
    In this case, take G to be GL(V), and take Δ to
    be the flag complex of subspaces of V. The stabilizer
    B of the fundamental chamber is the upper-triangular
    matrices. The stabilizer N of the fundamental apartment
    is the monomial matrices; the subgroup T fixing the
    fundamental apartment is the diagonal matrices; and the
    Weyl group W is the quotient N/T, which can be identified
    with the permutation matrices.

A Construction of Representations of Weyl Groups
T.A. Springer, 1978

    Let g be a complex semi-simple Lie algebra and A\in g a
    nilpotent element. Let G
    be the adjoint complex Lie group defined by g and denote
    by B_A^G the variety of Borel subgroups of G whose 
    Lie algebra contains A. Fix a maximal torus T of G
    and let W be its Weyl group. In this paper we shall construct
    representations of W in the graded cohomology H*(B_A^G, Q)

Why are the characters of the symmetric group integer-valued?
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/10635/
    The quickest answer is because all of the irreducible
    representations of the symmetric group can be constructed
    over the field of rational numbers. See the wikipedia
    article on Young symmetrizers for example 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_symmetrizer
    
    More generally, one can say that representations of any
    finite Weyl group can be constructed over the rational
    numbers. This is explained in one of Springer's papers:
    http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=491988
    
    Another reason is that one write down an explicit combinatorial
    formula for the values of these characters. This is the
    Murnaghan-Nakayama rule and can be found in many sources.
    One such source is Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics
    volume 2, Section 7.17, and Section 7.18 for its connection
    to the symmetric group.

    This points to an unusual property of symmetric groups
    and other Weyl groups which is much stronger than the
    fact that their characters take values in $\mathbb{Z}$:
    the representing matrices can actually be written over
    $\mathbb{Q}$. Of course, the price of this stronger statement
    is doing more work than just showing that character values
    (always algebraic integers) are rational

On Klein’s Icosahedral Solution of the Quintic
Oliver Nash
    From one point of view, the exceptional geometry of the
    quintic is a result of the exceptional isomorphism:
    A5 ~= P SL(2, 5)
    Corresponding to the exact sequence defining the level-5
    principal congruence subgroup of the modular group:
    0 → Γ(5) → P SL(2, Z) → P SL(2, 5) → 0
    there is a factorization of the modular quotient:
    j : H ∗ j5 −→ X(5) Iˆ −→ X(1)

“A motive is supposed to come with a product of l-adic
Galois representations, whose Frobenius eigenvalues would
be related to Hecke eigenvalues by reciprocity?” Arthur
wrote. “But could we not argue that the latter are closely
related to quantum mechanics-like spectra, being ‘momentum
observables’ in the sense that they commute with the
Laplacian/Hamiltonian?” -- Jim Arthur

Numerical and analytical bounds on threshold error rates for hypergraph-product codes
Alexey A. Kovalev, Sanjay Prabhakar, Ilya Dumer, Leonid P. Pryadko
    we analyze numerically the low-disorder
    portion of the phase diagram of the two random-bond
    Ising models corresponding to the ML decoding of (3, 4)
    QHP codes with i.i.d. bit-flip errors. For a CSS code with
    generators G = Gx and H = Gz, the corresponding Ising
    models have the free energies Fe(G; K) and Fe(H∗ ; K),
    see Eqs. (4) and (15), where e is the binary error vector
    whose non-zero bits indicate the flipped bonds, and
    K = 1/T is the inverse temperature. These models, respectively,
    correspond to the numerator and the denominator
    of the conditional ML decoding probability (5).

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph
    Every group character \chi of the group
    G induces an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of 
    \Gamma (G,S). The associated eigenvalue is 
    \lambda_{\chi }=\sum_{s\in S}\chi(s)
Really??? I think this is only true for abelian G.

    I argue that the mathematical

    terminology for the so-called real
    numbers is “random numbers”, as their series of bits
    are truly random. I propose an alternative classical
    mechanics that uses only finite-information numbers.
    This alternative classical mechanics is
    non-deterministic, despite the use of deterministic equations,
    in a way similar to quantum theory

    "anyone who claims that the universe is fundamentally

Obituary for a Flea
Jasper van Heugten, Sander Wolters
(Submitted on 18 Oct 2016)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06093
    The Landsman-Reuvers proposal to solve the measurement
    problem from within quantum theory is extensively analysed.
    In favor of proposals of this kind, it is shown that
    the standard reasoning behind objections to solving the
    measurement problem from within quantum theory rely on
    counterfactual reasoning or mathematical idealisations.
    Subsequently, a list of objections/challenges to the
    proposal are made. Part of these objections are equally
    important for all attempts at solving the measurement
    problem, such as the problem of interpreting small numbers
    in the density matrix, the problem of reproducing the
    Born rule, the use of pure states as a tool to alleviate
    the interpretational issues of quantum states, and the
    necessity of introducing classical certainties which
    are not strictly present in quantum theory. The additional
    objections that are particular to the proposal, such
    as the physical interpretation/origin of the flea perturbation,
    the use of potentials to solve a dynamical problem, slow
    collapse times, the inability to handle unequal probabilities,
    and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead
    us to believe that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking
    in both physical grounding and theoretical promise. Finally,
    an overview is given of the challenges that were encountered
    in this attempt to solve the measurement problem from
    within quantum theory.

> Hi Simon,

> Since the two of us are both interested in the categorified Gram-Schmidt
> process, I thought it might be nice to work out on the side some things
> which we've learned from Jim (maybe you've done this already).

Yes, I'm very keen. I did a bunch of calculations of Burnside rings of
finite groups. Actually I wrote programs that did the calculations.
This was quite interesting, and closely related to this Gram-Schmidt
process.

One concrete question I have is regarding the dihedral group of order 8, 
which I will call B_2.
The treatment on the nLab focuses on the symmetric groups and the G-sets
coming from parabolic subgroups. There are other (stabilizer)
subgroups apart from these, and I found with B_2 that I could just use
all of the subgroups (up to conjugacy) when building the M matrix.

Then after row reduction, this matrix ends up with some zero rows, but
still manages to record the irreducibles in each permutation representation.

Maybe I'm not being very clear, so let me give some details.

There are 8 subgroups of B_2 up to conjugacy, and
here they are labelled A through H, along with a description of the 
corresponding "structure" stabilized:

    A order = 8, stabilizes nothing
    B order = 4, stabilizes a short axis
    C order = 4, stabilizes a long axis
    D order = 4, stabilizes an orientation
    E order = 2, stabilizes a corner
    F order = 2, stabilizes an edge
    G order = 2, stabilizes an opposite (unordered) pair of flags
    H order = 1, stabilizes a flag.

This description is with respect to the usual action on a square.
A flag is an incident corner and edge.
Each of E and F are conjugate to another subgroup, I think this
has something to do with the stabilizer of a corner also stabilizing
the opposite corner.
The subgroups E and F are the only subgroups that have conjugate subgroups. 

We can multiply (tensor) the corresponding permutation representations,
and there's a boatload of ways of describing this multiplication,
double cosets being one of them. James likes to talk about "geometric
relationships". 

So here is the multiplication table for B_2:

  | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
--+----------------------------
A | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
B | B 2B G  G  2E   H    2G 2H 
C | C G  2C G  H    2F   2G 2H 
D | D G  G  2D H    H    2G 2H 
E | E 2E H  H  2E+H 2H   2H 4H 
F | F H  2F H  2H   2F+H 2H 4H 
G | G 2G 2G 2G 2H   2H   4G 4H 
H | H 2H 2H 2H 4H   4H   4H 8H 

If we just count the double cosets we get this:

  | A B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
A | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
B | 1  2  1  1  2  1  2  2  
C | 1  1  2  1  1  2  2  2  
D | 1  1  1  2  1  1  2  2  
E | 1  2  1  1  3  2  2  4  
F | 1  1  2  1  2  3  2  4  
G | 1  2  2  2  2  2  4  4  
H | 1  2  2  2  4  4  4  8  

After row reduction:

  | A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
V | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
W | .  1  .  .  1  .  1  1  
X | .  .  1  .  .  1  1  1  
Y | .  .  .  1  .  .  1  1  
Z | .  .  .  .  1  1  .  2  

I got rid of the zero rows,
and the leftover rows are labelled by the irreducible representations.

As we see from the H column, B_2 has four 1-dimensional
irreducible representations, and one 2-dimensional irreducible representation.

I guess my second question is, how can we just blithly add and
subtract double cosets...? 

> As a computational side note: if the permutation representation P attached

> Q> can be represented as having a basis Stab(c) \ G / Stab(d)  consisting
> of double cosets.

This seems to have something to do with my question. Perhaps I just
need to do some more examples. My understanding of the usual representation
theory is not great, but it seems that the way they would normally
"kill off" a part of a reducible representation involves a summation
over the elements of the group while multiplying by a character
Something like that. (i really don't understand this very well.)
So I'm wondering if that is going on here aswell, "under the hood".

How to Draw a Group
Alexander Zvonkin
    Abstract
    A map is at the same time a group. To represent a map (that
    is, a graph drawn on the sphere or on another surface) we usually
    use a pair of permutations on the set of the \ends" of edges. These
    permutations generate a group which we call a cartographic group.
    The main motivation for the study of the cartographic group is the
    so-called theory of \dessins d'enfants" of Grothendieck, which relates
    the theory of maps to Galois theory [24].
    In the present paper we address the questions of identifying the
    cartographic group for a given map, and of constructing the maps
    with a given cartographic group

    Theorem: The group of rotations of the icosahedron is
    of order 60, simple, and isomorphic to the alternating
    group A5. Therefore, A5 is simple.

    icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 faces.

    The compound of 5 octahedra: Consider the construction
    of three orthogonal golden rectangles inscribed in the
    icosahedron. The six short sides are edges of the icosahedron,
    and we can paint them with the same color. Observe that,
    whenever an edge e is chosen, there is a unique way
    to build the rectangles in such a way that the edge e
    is one of the short sides, so in this way the 30 edges
    can be painted with 5 different colors. The midpoints
    of the edges of each color are the vertices of an octahedron,
    so we have formed a compound of 5 octahedra.

Butcher series: A story of rooted trees and numerical methods for evolution equations
    Butcher series appear when Runge-Kutta methods for ordinary
    differential equations are expanded in power series of
    the step size parameter. Each term in a Butcher series
    consists of a weighted elementary differential, and the
    set of all such differentials is isomorphic to the set
    of rooted trees, as noted by Cayley in the mid 19th century.
    A century later Butcher discovered that rooted trees
    can also be used to obtain the order conditions of Runge-Kutta
    methods, and he found a natural group structure, today
    known as the Butcher group. It is now known that many
    numerical methods also can be expanded in Butcher series;
    these are called B-series methods. A long-standing problem
    has been to characterize, in terms of qualitative features,
    all B-series methods. Here we tell the story of Butcher
    series, stretching from the early work of Cayley, to
    modern developments and connections to abstract algebra,
    and finally to the resolution of the characterization
    problem. This resolution introduces geometric tools and
    perspectives to an area traditionally explored using
    analysis and combinatorics.

"Spectral gaps of frustration-free spin systems with boundary"
Marius Lemm, Evgeny Mozgunov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08915.pdf
"""
A central question concerning a quantum many-body system is whether it
is gapped or gapless. (By definition, a system is “gapped” if the difference
between the two lowest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian remains uniformly
bounded away from zero in the thermodynamic limit. Otherwise, it is gapless.)
    The importance of this concept stems from the fact that ground states
of gapped systems enjoy many useful properties. For instance, they display
exponential decay of correlations [28]. In one dimension, more is known: The
ground states satisfy an area law for the entanglement entropy [2, 17] and
can be well approximated in polynomial time [3, 21]. Moreover, the closing
of the spectral gap (as a parameter in the Hamiltonian is varied) indicates a
quantum phase transition, and is therefore related to topological order, e.g.,
via the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem [16, 23]. To summarize, the existence of
a spectral gap is a fortunate occurrence that has far-reaching consequences
for low-temperature physics. (It is also rare in a probabilistic sense [24].)
    It is well-known that the existence of a spectral gap may depend on the
imposed boundary conditions, and this fact is at the core of our work.
    In general, the question whether a quantum spin system is gapped or
gapless is difficult: In 1D, the Haldane conjecture [14, 15] (“antiferromagnetic,
integer-spin Heisenberg chains are gapped”) remains open after 30
years of investigation. In 2D, the “gapped versus gapless” dichotomy is in
fact undecidable in general [10], even among the class of translation-invariant,
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians

An Introduction to the Cohomology of Groups
Peter J. Webb
http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~webb/oldteaching/Year2010-11/8246CohomologyNotes.pdf

For H^2(G, A)
when G=C_2 x C_2 and A=C_2
there are eight equivalence classes of
extensions:
    1 of C_2 x C_2 x C_2
    3 of C_4 x C_2
    3 of D_8
    1 of Q_8  <--- quaternion group

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/11306/character-table-does-not-determine-group-vs-tannaka-duality
    From the example D4, Q, we see that the character
    table of a group doesn't determine the group up to isomorphism.
    On the other hand, Tannaka duality says that a group
    G is determined by its representation ring R(G).

Hodge Laplacians on Graphs
Lek-Heng Lim
    Abstract. This is an elementary introduction to the Hodge Laplacian on a
    graph, a higher-order generalization of the graph Laplacian. We will discuss
    basic properties including cohomology and Hodge theory. At the end we will
    also discuss the nonlinear Laplacian on a graph, a nonlinear generalization of
    the graph Laplacian as its name implies. These generalized Laplacians will be
    constructed out of coboundary operators, i.e., discrete analogues of exterior
    derivatives. The main feature of our approach is simplicity — this article
    requires only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory.

Towers of generalized divisible quantum codes
Jeongwan Haah
Sep 27 2017 quant-ph arXiv:1709.08658v1
    A divisible binary classical code is one in which every
    code word has weight divisible by a fixed integer. If
    the divisor is 2ν for a positive integer ν, then one
    can construct a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, where
    X-stabilizer space is the divisible classical code,
    that admits a transversal gate in the ν-th level of
    Clifford hierarchy. We consider a generalization of the
    divisibility by allowing a coefficient vector of odd
    integers with which every code word has zero dot product
    modulo the divisor. In this generalized sense, we construct
    a CSS code with divisor 2ν+1 and code distance d
    from any CSS code of code distance d and divisor 2ν
    where the transversal X is a nontrivial logical operator.
    The encoding rate of the new code is approximately d
    times smaller than that of the old code. In particular,
    for large d and ν≥2, our construction yields a CSS
    code of parameters [[O(dν−1),Ω(d),d]]
    admitting a transversal gate at the ν-th level of Clifford
    hierarchy. For our construction we introduce a conversion
    from magic state distillation protocols based on Clifford
    measurements to those based on codes with transversal
    T-gates. Our tower contains, as a subclass, generalized
    triply even CSS codes that have appeared in so-called
    gauge fixing or code switching methods.

Eilenberg–MacLane spaces
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology#Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_spaces
    There is a related description of the first cohomology
    with coefficients in any abelian group A, say for a CW
    complex X. Namely, H1(X,A) is in one-to-one correspondence
    with the set of isomorphism classes of Galois covering
    spaces of X with group A, also called principal A-bundles
    over X. For X connected, it follows that H1(X,A) is isomorphic
    to Hom(π1X,A), where π1X is the fundamental group of
    X. For example, H1(X,Z/2) classifies the double covering
    spaces of X, with the element 0 ∈ H1(X,Z/2) corresponding
    to the trivial double covering, the disjoint union of
    two copies of X.

    are the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of M.


"ZETA FUNCTIONS OF GRAPHS"
Graph theory meets number theory in this stimulating book. Ihara zeta functions of
finite graphs are reciprocals of polynomials, sometimes in several variables. Analogies
abound with number-theoretic functions such as Riemann or Dedekind zeta functions.
For example, there is a Riemann hypothesis (which may be false) and a prime number
theorem for graphs. Explicit constructions of graph coverings use Galois theory to
generalize Cayley and Schreier graphs. Then non-isomorphic simple graphs with the
same zeta function are produced, showing that you cannot “hear” the shape of a graph.
The spectra of matrices such as the adjacency and edge adjacency matrices of a
graph are essential to the plot of this book, which makes connections with quantum
chaos and random matrix theory and also with expander and Ramanujan graphs, of
interest in computer science. Pitched at beginning graduate students, the book will also
appeal to researchers. Many well-chosen illustrations and exercises, both theoretical
and computer-based, are included throughout.

Zeta Functions of Finite Graphs and Coverings, Part II
H.M.Stark A.A.Terras
Galois theorem (roughly):
    let Y be an (unramified) normal covering of X
    with Galois group G=G(Y/X).
    Then intermediate graphs correspond bijectively to
    subgroups of G, and subgroup inclusion H1<=H2 corresponds to
    covering Y>=Y1>=Y2>=X.

    A ``prime'' [C] in X is an equivalence class of primitive
    closed backtrackless, tailless cycles C such that C!=D^m, m>=2 and D a
    path in X. For brevity, we will sometimes refer to primitive closed
    backtrackless tailless cycles C as prime cycles.

"""
both the Desargues graph
and the dodecahedron graph are double covers of the Petersen graph.
For a labeled graph, each double cover corresponds uniquely to an
element of the Z/2Z cohomology of the graph (for an unlabeled
graph, some of the double covers defined in this way may turn out
to be isomorphic). Cohomology over Z/2Z takes any cycle as input
and returns either 0 or 1, in a consistent way (the output of a Z/2Z
sum of cycles is the sum of the outputs on each cycle). The double
cover has two copies of everything in the base (Petersen) graph, and
as you follow all the way around a cycle in the base, the element of
cohomology tells you whether you come back to the same copy (for
0) or the other copy (for 1) in the double cover, compared to where
you started.
One well-defined double cover for any graph is the one which simply
switches copies for every single edge (this corresponding to the ele-
ment of cohomology which is 1 on all odd cycles and 0 on all even
cycles). This always gives a double cover which is a bipartite graph,
and which is connected if and only if the base graph is connected
and not bipartite.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-virtual-representation

We can force this subtraction to always make sense by
considering a weaker notion of equivalence of representations
than isomorphism. The Grothendieck group K0(G) of
representations of G is the free abelian group on isomorphism
classes of representations of G, modulo the relation that

[V]=[U]+[W] if V≅U⊕W

When X is a representation, we write [X] for its
class in the Grothendieck group. Because of this definition,
there are symbols such as −[X] in K0(G). But
there is no guarantee that there is any representation
YY such that [Y]=−[X] (in fact, for nice enough
groups and X,Y≠0, this never happens).

To answer the original question: a virtual representation
is an element of K0(G) that is not (necessarily)
the class of a representation of G.

    There are many uses of the word ‘spectrum’ in mathematics,
    and most of them are related. 
    In particular, the spectrum of a linear operator on a
    finite-dimensional vector space — that is, its set of
    eigenvalues — can be seen as the spectrum of an associated
    commutative ring.

    Let T:V->V be a linear operator on V with minimal
    polynomial m(x).
    End(V) is the k-algebra of linear operators on V.
    the homomorphism f:k[x]->End(V) sending x to T has
    kernel (m(x)) and image the subalgebra of End(V) 
    generated by T.
    So k[x]/(m(x)) is isomorphic to this subalgebra.

    perturbations of T lift the degeneracy of
    the eigenvalues, so that m(x) is the characteristic polynomial...

    the characteristic polynomial is the “continuous minimum polynomial”.

Let B be a finite type C-algebra.
Then B = C[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fk)
and Spec B is the variety cut out of C^n by f1,...,fk.

     if R is a commutative-ring type object in some category
    of geometric objects, and X is a geometric object carrying
    a sufficient supply of maps to R, then it is worthwhile
    to look at the ring of functions from X to R, as this
    object will carry a lot of information on X. In the
    other direction, it is often useful to study commutative-ring
    objects by trying to realize them as rings of functions
    on some geometric object, their "spectrum". However,
    even with this in mind, it is still quite striking that
    this approach yields so many anti-equivalences between
    full subcategories of geometric objects and full subcategories
    of commutative-algebraic objects. It is like the geometer/topologist/homotopy-theorist
    is walking on one continent, and the commutative-algebraist
    is walking on another, and yet they keep stumbling upon
    the exact same species of categories (only in reverse).

    ~~~~~~~

    Note that topological spaces are already very nearly
    defined to be dual to certain commutative algebra-like
    structures, namely their frames of open subsets. The
    simplest interesting case of this duality is a duality
    between finite sets and finite Boolean rings / algebras.
    One way to think about this conceptually is that the
    open subsets of a topological space axiomatize verifiable
    or semidecidable properties of a point in that space:
    that is, properties such that if they hold you can check
    that that's true, but such that if they don't hold you
    can't necessarily check that that's true. See this math.SE
    question for more discussion on this point. For example,
    the open sets in the product topology on {0,1}N{0,1}N
    correspond precisely to those properties of an infinite
    sequence of zeroes and ones that you can verify by looking
    at finitely many terms of the sequence. (Once we agree
    that verifiable properties are a cool thing to look at,
    we should also agree that we care about logical operations
    on them, like AND and OR, and this is where the commutative
    algebra-like structure comes from.)

    Why is FinSet so important, anyway? Well, one categorical
    property that categories of spaces often share that isn't
    true in general is that binary products tend to distribute
    over binary coproducts. This is true in particular in
    any cartesian closed category, such as Set, and any
    category with this property behaves in some sense like
    a categorified commutative ring (!). It turns out that
    FinSet is the free distibutive category on a point.

    ~~~~~~~~

    All these five equivalences Cop≃DCop≃D follow the following
    pattern: There is an object PP which, in some sense,
    belongs to both CC and DD. More precisely, there are
    objects PC∈CPC∈C and PD∈DPD∈D which are "similar" in
    the sense that for example they share the same underlying
    set, maybe more. Moreover, the hom-functor hom(−,PC)hom⁡(−,PC)
    lifts to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PC):Cop→D,
    
    hom_(−,PC):Cop→D,
    and likewise hom(−,PD)hom⁡(−,PD) to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PD):D→Cop.
    hom_(−,PD):D→Cop.
    Then in most examples it is rather easy to construct
    an adjunction between these functors, since unit and
    counit may be defined as "evaluation"
    X→hom–––––(hom–––––(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    X→hom_(hom_(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    For more details, see the nlab article on dualizing objects.
    This is the purely formal part. The nontrivial part is
    to determine the fixed objects of this adjunction. If
    we are lucky, every object is a fixed object, so that
    Cop≃DCop≃D. But often, we have to shrink CC and DD further.
    
    
    In Gelfand duality (2), P=CP=C "is" both an object of
    TopTop and of ∗Alg∗Alg (unital ∗∗-algebras), and the
    Gelfand spectrum
    hom–––––∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    hom_∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    is left adjoint to the function algebra
    hom–––––Top(−,C):Topop→∗Alg.



https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35629/how-is-representation-theory-used-in-modular-automorphic-forms
    the basic link to representation theory is that modular
    forms (and automorphic forms) can be viewed as functions
    in representation spaces of reductive groups. What I
    mean is the following: take for example a modular form,
    i.e. a function ff on the upper-half plane satisfying
    certain conditions. Since the upper-half plane is a quotient
    of G=GL(2,R)G=GL(2,R), you can pull ff back to a function
    on GG (technically you massage it a bit, but this is
    the main idea) which will be invariant under a discrete
    subgroup ΓΓ. Functions that look like this are called
    automorphic forms on GG. The space all automorphic forms
    on GG is a representation of GG (via the right regular
    represenation, i.e. (gf)(x)=f(xg)(gf)(x)=f(xg)). Basically,
    any irreducible subrepresentation of the space of automorphic
    forms is what is called an automorphic representation
    of GG. So, modular forms can be viewed as certain vectors
    in certain (generally infinite-dimensional) representations
    of GG. In this context, one can define the Hecke algebra
    of GG as the complex-valued C∞C∞ functions on GG with
    compact support viewed as a ring under convolution. This
    is a substitute for the group ring that occurs in the
    representation theory of finite groups, i.e. the (possibly
    infinite-dimensional) group representations of GG should
    correspond to the (possibly infinite-dimensional) algebra
    representations of its Hecke algebra. This type of stuff
    is the basic connection of modular forms to representation
    theory and it goes back at least to Gelfand–Graev–Piatestkii-Shapiro's
    Representation theory and automorphic functions. You
    can replace GG with a general reductive group.
    ...

    A modular form is a highest weight vector of a discrete
    series summand of L2(SL2(Z)\SL2(R)).

    called the "representation ring" of A - it's a ring because

    K(A) is called the "K-theory of X".

    ways of doing this. Repeated folding and reversing arrows
    and unfolding, yields, for example, the sequence: D4
    - G2 - E6 - F4 - E7. One may interpret the reversals
    in terms of Frobenius reciprocity.
    ...
    
    They are also being used in finding the spectral lines
    associated with the newly discovered C60 molecules of

    Every (associative, unital) ring is a subring of the

    act on abelian groups; groups act on sets. The universal
    action on an abelian group is its endomorphism ring;
    the universal action on a set is the symmetric group.
    Modules are rings that remember their action on an abelian
    group; permutation groups are groups that remember their
    action on a set. (Jack Schmidt)

    You can think of Cayley's theorem as the special case

    If you take the additive version of Yoneda's lemma, and

    part of the proof that reveals the self-referential nature
    of elementary number theory, for example, since in talking
    about numbers we can in effect talk about statements
    involving numbers. Ultimately, we arrive in this way
    at a sentence that asserts its own unprovability, and
    this gives the Incompleteness Theorem straight away.
    
    But there are other coding methods besides the Chinese
    Remainder theorem, and not all of them involve primes
    directly. For example, the only reason Goedel needed
    CRT was that he worked in a very limited formal language,
    just the ring theory language. But one can just as easily
    work in a richer language, with all primitive recursive
    functions, and the proof proceeds mostly as before, with
    a somewhat easier time for the coding part, involving
    no primes. Other proofs formalize the theory in the hereditary
    finite sets HF, which is mutually interpreted with the
    natural numbers N, and then the coding is fundamentally
    set-theoretic, also involving no primes numbers especially.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/58696/why-study-lie-algebras
Let GG be a semi-simple Lie group, let KK be its maximal
compact subgroup, let ΓΓ be a discrete subgroup of GG,
and form G/K.G/K. This quotient is called the symmetric
space attached to GG.

The Riemanian structure comes from an invariant metric on
GG, and so GG acts as isometries on G/KG/K by left translation.

If you consider the case G=SL2(R)G=SL2(R), you get SL2(R)/SO(2)SL2(R)/SO(2),
which is naturally identified with the complex upper
half-plane (on which SL2(R)SL2(R) acts via Mobius transformations;
note that the point ii is stablized precisely by SO(2)SO(2)),
which is also the hyperbolic plane. Other groups give
higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces (e.g. SL2(C)SL2(C)
gives hyperbolic 33-space), the Siegel upper half-spaces
(from symplectic groups), complex balls, and many other
well-known spaces.

If you now take a discrete subgroup ΓΓ of GG, you can
form the double quotient Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K. These are some of
the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics.
In the case of SL2(R)SL2(R), we know via uniformization
that all genus ≥2≥2 Riemann surfaces can be described
in this way. In the case of SL2(C)SL2(C) we get hyperbolic
33-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces
of abelian varieties, ... .

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K
for certain ΓΓ (so-called congruence subgroups) is one
of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the
function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially
their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured
to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand
and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for
learning Lie theory.

The Poincaré half-plane for informationally complete POVMs
Michel Planat
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06768
    It has been shown that classes of (minimal asymmetric)
    informationally complete POVMs in dimension d can be
    built using the multiparticle Pauli group acting on appropriate
    fiducial states [M. Planat and Z. Gedik, R. Soc. open
    sci. 4, 170387 (2017)]. The latter states may also be
    derived starting from the Poincar\'e upper half-plane
    model H. For doing this, one translates the congruence
    (or non-congruence) subgroups of index d of the modular
    group into groups of permutation gates whose some of
    the eigenstates are the seeked fiducials. The structure
    of some IC-POVMs is found to be intimately related to
    the Kochen-Specker theorem.

Interpretation of quantum mechanics with indefinite norm
Alessandro Strumia
    (Submitted on 14 Sep 2017)
    The Born postulate can be reduced to its deterministic
    content that only applies to eigenvectors of observables:
    the standard probabilistic interpretation of generic
    states then follows from algebraic properties of repeated
    measurements and states. Extending this reasoning suggests
    an interpretation of quantum mechanics generalized with
    indefinite quantum norm.

A Completely Top-Down Hierarchical Structure in Quantum Mechanics
Yakir Aharonov, Eliahu Cohen, Jeff Tollaksen
    (Submitted on 20 Sep 2017)
    Can a large system be fully characterized using its subsystems
    via inductive reasoning? Is it possible to completely
    reduce the behavior of a complex system to the behavior
    of its simplest "atoms"? In the following paper we answer
    these questions on the negative for a specific class
    of systems and measurements. We begin with simple two-particle
    example, where strong correlations arise between two
    apparently empty boxes. This leads to new surprising
    effects within atomic and electromagnetic systems. A
    general construction based on pre- and post-selected
    ensembles is then suggested, where the N-body correlation
    can be genuinely perceived as a global property, as long
    as one is limited to preforming a small set of measurements
    which we term "strictly local". We conclude that within
    time-symmetric quantum mechanics and under certain boundary
    conditions, high-order correlations can determine low-order
    ones, but not vice versa. Moreover, the latter seem to
    provide no information at all regarding the former. This
    supports a top-down structure in many-body quantum mechanics.


Introduction to Quantum Logical Information Theory
David Ellerman
    (Submitted on 15 Jul 2017 (v1), last revised 17 Aug 2017 (this version, v2))
    Logical information theory is the quantitative version
    of the logic of partitions just as logical probability
    theory is the quantitative version of the dual Boolean
    logic of subsets. The resulting notion of information
    is about distinctions, differences, and distinguishability,
    and is formalized as the distinctions of a partition
    (a pair of points distinguished by the partition). All
    the definitions of simple, joint, conditional, and mutual
    entropy of Shannon information theory are derived by
    a uniform transformation from the corresponding definitions
    at the logical level. The purpose of this paper is to
    give the direct generalization to quantum logical information
    theory that similarly focuses on the pairs of eigenstates
    distinguished by an observable, i.e., qubits of an observable.
    The fundamental theorem for quantum logical entropy and
    measurement establishes a direct quantitative connection
    between the increase in quantum logical entropy due to
    a projective measurement and the eigenstates (cohered
    together in the pure superposition state being measured)
    that are distinguished by the measurement (decohered
    in the post-measurement mixed state). Both the classical
    and quantum versions of logical entropy have simple interpretations
    as "two-draw" probabilities. The conclusion is that quantum
    logical entropy is the simple and natural notion of information
    for a quantum information theory focusing on the distinguishing
    of quantum states.

Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations
Anthony W. Knapp and David A . Vogan, Jr.
(scary book)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Abstract-Homotopy.pdf

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1534/induction-and-coinduction-of-representations

    If you have any homomorphism f: H -> G, you get a restriction
    functor f* on representations, but the existence of adjoints
    depends on the existence of certain limits, in particular,
    how large you allow representations to be. Formally,
    you get an induction f! that takes V to the tensor product
    over group algebras (or a fiber product with G if you're
    working with G-sets or G-spaces) which is infinite dimensional
    if G/f(H) is infinite. Similarly, the coinduction f*
    takes V to H-module homomorphisms from the group algebra
    of G to V (or H-equivariant maps from G). This also works
    for Lie algebras and algebraic groups without significant
    alteration - when working with Lie algebras you use the
    universal enveloping algebras in place of group rings.
    If your groups, algebras, and representations come with
    smooth/algebraic/topological structure, then the definition
    gets more complicated due to completions, etc.
    
    There is a fancy way to view representations as sheaves on
    a classifying stack BG, so the homomorphism f describes
    a pointed map BH -> BG, and the upper and lower stars
    and shrieks correspond to the usual sheaf operations.
    Sometimes people use derived versions of these functors,
    and apparently get useful results (although I don't recall
    any of them in particular). The induction operation can
    be thought of as a pushforward with proper (compact)
    supports while coinduction is a plain pushforward. A
    coinduced module tends to be "bigger", e.g., if you start
    with the trivial representation of the trivial group,
    the coinduced representation is the dual of the induced
    representation. Induction may use half-forms on fibers
    of a map, since the product of two half-forms is a volume
    and can be integrated along fibers to get functions on
    the target.


Modal quantum theory
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2929
    We present a discrete model theory similar in structure
    to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite
    field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation
    of this theory involves only the "modal" concepts of
    possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability
    measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes
    entangled states and has versions of both Bell's theorem
    and the no cloning theorem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer's_theorem_on_induced_characters
    Using Frobenius reciprocity, Brauer's induction theorem
    leads easily to his fundamental characterization of characters,
    which asserts that a complex-valued class function of
    G is a virtual character if and only if its restriction
    to each Brauer elementary subgroup of G is a virtual
    character. This result, together with the fact that a
    virtual character θ is an irreducible character if and
    only if θ(1) > 0 and {\displaystyle \langle \theta ,\theta
    \rangle =1}￼ (where {\displaystyle \langle ,\rangle }￼
    is the usual inner product on the ring of complex-valued
    class functions) gives a means of constructing irreducible
    characters without explicitly constructing the associated
    representations.

Yes, there's a category of that sort where the objects are groupoids and
the morphisms are (equivalence classes of) spans of groupoids.   But it's
better to think of it as a bicategory, at least.  I wrote about this stuff
here:

2-Vector Spaces and Groupoids
Jeffrey C. Morton
https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2361
There are two major philosophies regarding how to categorify the concept “vector
space”. A Baez-Crans (BC) 2-vector space is a category object in Vect—that is, a
category having a vector space of objects and of morphisms, where source, target,
composition, etc. are linear maps. This is a useful concept for some purposes—it
was developed to give a categorification of Lie algebras. The reader may refer to
the paper of Baez and Crans [3] for more details. However, a BC 2-vector space
turns out to be equivalent to a 2-term chain complex and for many purposes this
is too strict. 

Categories of Mackey Functors
Elango Panchadcharam
PhD Thesis, 2007

    {}^g H = g H g^{-1}
Let [K\G/H]\subseteq G represent all double cosets
in the form KgH where g\in[K\G/H], without repitition.

Mackey Decomposition Theorem: 
    For subgroups H and K of a group G,
    there is a canonical natural isomorphism
    Res(G, K) o Ind(G, H) = 
        \sum_{g\in[K\G/H]} 
            Ind(K, {}^g H\cap K) o
            Res(\gamma_g) o

Mackey functors on compact closed categories
Ross Street, Elango Panchadcharam
https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2922
    Mackey functors, a concept going back at least as far
    as [Gr], [Dr] and [Di] in group representation theory,
    can be regarded as functors out of the category of spans
    in a suitable category E . The important property of
    the category of spans is that it is compact closed.

    F:FinVect→FinVect
    F: \Fin\Vect \to \Fin\Vect
    where FinVect Fin\Vect is the category of finite-dimensional
    complex space. Namely, it is one where F(V) F(V) is obtained
    by taking a tensor power of V V, say V⊗n V^{\otimes n},
    and then picking out the subspace that transforms according
    to a particular irreducible representation of the symmetric
    group Sn S_n, which acts on V⊗n V^{\otimes n} by permuting

What Is “Fundamental”
October 28, 2017 to January 22, 2018
https://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules

    Interesting physical systems can be described in a variety
    of languages. A cell, for example, might be understood
    in terms for example of quantum or classical mechanics,
    of computation, or information processing, of biochemistry,
    of evolution and genetics, or of behavior and function.
    We often consider some of these descriptions “more fundamental”
    than other more “emergent” ones, and many physicists
    pride themselves on pursuing the most fundamental sets
    of rules. But what exactly does it mean?
    
    Are “more fundamental” constituents physically smaller? Not
    always: if inflation is correct, quanta of the inflaton
    field are as large as the observable universe.
    
    Are “less fundamental” things made out of “more fundamental”
    ones? Perhaps – but while a cell is indeed "made of"
    atoms, it is perhaps more so “made of" structural and
    genetic information that is part of a long historical
    and evolutionary process. Is that process more fundamental
    than the cell?
    
    Does a “more fundamental” description uniquely specify a “less
    fundamental” one? Not in many cases: consider string
    theory, with its landscape of 10500 or more low-energy
    limits. And the same laws of statistical mechanics can
    apply to many types of statistically described constituents.
    
    Is “more fundamental” more economical or elegant in terms
    of concepts or entities? Only sometimes: a computational
    description of a circuit may be much more elegant than
    a wavefunction one. And there are hints that even gravity,
    a paragon of elegance, may be revealed as a statistical
    description of something else.



https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/602632/induced-representations


The weakest statement one can make is that for any subgroup
H≤GH≤G and any complex irreducible representation ρρ
of GG, ρρ is a summand of some induced representation
from HH. This follows immediately from Frobenius reciprocity.

But there are much stronger results, which go under the
bracketing name of "induction theorems". Their common
feature is that they say that certain representations
of a finite group GG are obtained as linear combinations
of certain representations induced from certain subgroups.

FINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS
ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3411.pdf

A finite k-regular graph X is called
an eta-expander (0<eta) if for every subset
of vertices A of X, with |A|<= 1/2 |X|,
|bdy(A)|>= eta |A| where bdy(A)={y in X|d(y,A)=1}.

Theorem 1.1: there exist k in N, and 0<eta in R,
such that if G is a finite simple group of Lie type,
but not a Suzuki group, then G has a set of k
generators S for which the Cayley graph Cay(G;S) is
an eta expander.

holds for arbitrary non-abelian finite simple group:
"Finite Simple Groups as Expanders"
Martin Kassabov, Alexander Lubotzky, Nikolay Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510562.pdf

Proposition 2. A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 iff there exists 0<alpha
such that for every i, and for every unitary rep V of G_i,
a vector v in V which is “S-almost invariant” is also 
“G-almost invariant”.

Let X=Cay(G;S), k=|S cup S^{-1}| and Delta = 1/k A
where A is adjacency matrix of X.
Then lambda_1(X)=1.

Proposition 3.  A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 if lambda_2(X_i)<1-delta
for some delta>0 and for all i.
(Note: We do not assume that the sets S_i are of bounded
size. If Si are bounded then the converse is also true.)

Ie. If gapped then eta-expander.

Therefore: if not eta-expander then gapless.

"Universal lattices and property tau"
M. Kassabov and N. Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0502112.pdf
Let G be a discrete group generated by a finite set S. 
Then G has the property tau if there exists 
epsilon > 0 such that for every finite 
irreducible unitary representation
rho : G → U(H) on a Hilbert space H (necessary finite dimensional),
which contains an epsilon-invariant vector is trivial. 
The largest epsilon with this property
is called the tau-constant and is denoted by tau(G; S).
A vector v is called epsilon-invariant 
iff ||rho(s)v - v|| < epsilon ||v|| for all s in S.

Kazhdan property T implies property tau

About the course

The mathematics of expander graphs is studied by three distinct communities:
The algorithmic problem of finding a small balanced cut in a graph (that is, of finding a certificate that a graph is *not* an expander) is a fundamental problem in the area of approximation algorithms, and good algorithms for it have many applications, from doing image segmentation to driving divide-and-conquer procedures.
Explicit constructions of highly expanding graphs have many applications in algorithms, data structures, derandomization and cryptography; many constructions are algebraic, and lead to deep questions in group theory, but certain new constructions are purely combinatorial.
The speed of convergence of MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) algorithms is related to the expansion of certain exponentially big graphs, and so the analysis of such algorithms hinges on the ability to bound the expansion of such graphs.

The first converse theorems were proved by Hamburger
(1921) who characterized the Riemann zeta function by
its functional equation, and by Hecke (1936) who showed
that if a Dirichlet series satisfied a certain functional
equation and some growth conditions then it was the Mellin
transform of a modular form of level 1. Weil (1967) found
an extension to modular forms of higher level, which
was described by Ogg (1969, chapter V).

The "real clifford group" on n-qubits is generated by H and CNOT.
This is isomorphic to the finite symplectic group Sp(2n, 2).
|Sp(2n, q)| = q^{m^2}(q^{2m}-1)(q^{2m-2}-1)...(q^2-1)

Including the single qubit P gates:
P = [[1, 0], [0, i]]
we get the Clifford group C_n with 
|C_n| = 4^n |Sp(2n, 2)|

    It is proved that the ring of Siegel modular forms in
    any genus is determined by doubly even self-dual codes
    and the theta relations. The (higher) weight polynomials
    of such codes are proved to be the generators of the
    ring of invariants of a polynomial ring in 2g variables
    under a certain specified finite group. Moreover codes
    are uniquely determined by their weight polynomials.

The order of any finite field is a prime power, q=p^f.
These are unique for each q. F_q or GF(q).
F_p = Z/pZ
F_q is constructed from F_p by adding a root of any
irreducible polynomial of degree f over F_p.
It is also equal to the set of solutions of x^q=x in the
algebraic closure of F_p.

Chapter 4:
The theta functions associated to a Riemann surface

p153
The Jacobian variety associated to the Reimann surface \Sigma_g
endowed with canonical basis a j , b j , j = 1, 2, . . . , g, is
J(\Sigma_g) := \Complex^g / \Lambda(I,\Pi)

The additive group structure of \Complex^g is induced onto J(\Sigma_g)
and so this is an abelian variety.

    There are different kinds of equality. Let us say that
    equality is "intensional" if it distinguishes objects
    based on how they are defined, and "extensional" if it
    distinguishes objects based on their "extension" or "observable
    behavior". 
    
    To use Russell's example, intensionally the morning star
    and the evening star are clearly not the same (because
    their definitions are different), but they are extensionally
    the same because they both denote the same object (planet
    Venus). A more mathematical example is comparison of
    x+yx+y and y+xy+x. These are extensionally equal, but
    intensionally differ because (the usual) definition of
    ++ treats its arguments asymmetrically. It should be
    clear that two functions may be extensionally equal (have
    same behavior) even though they differ intensionally
    (have different definitions).
    
    It is possible for two kinds of equality to coexist. Thus
    in type theory there are two equalities. The intensional
    one is called "judgmental" or "definitional equality"
    ≡≡ and the extensional one is known as "propositional
    equality" ==. Mathematicians are aware of == as a "real
    thing" while they think of ≡≡ as "formal manipulation
    of symbolic expressions" or some such.
    
    We may control the two kinds of equality and the relationship
    between them with additional axioms. For instance, the
    reflection rule collapses ≡≡ and == by allowing us to
    conclude a≡ba≡b from a=ba=b (the other direction is automatic).
    There are also varying degrees of extensionality of ==.
    Without any extra axioms, == is already somewhat extensional.
    For instance, we can prove commutativity of ++ on natural
    numbers by induction in the form x+y=y+xx+y=y+x, but
    we cannot prove x+y≡y+xx+y≡y+x. Function extensionality
    is an axiom which describes what constitutes an "observation"
    on functions: by saying that two functions are equal
    when they give equal values we are in essence saying
    that only values matter (but not for example the "running
    time" or some other aspect of evaluation). Another axiom
    which makes == "more extensional" is the Univalence axiom.

The spectrum of a graph is the spectrum of its adjacency matrix.
J. H. Smith proved the following theorem.
    Theorem
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue strictly less than
        2 are precisely the ADE diagrams.
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue equal to 2 are
        precisely the extended ADE diagrams.
Although this theorem was proved in 1969, it is in some sense
implicit in the classification of simple Lie algebras over C.

Euler characteristic of a closed compact surface is <= 2.
Exactly 2 only for the sphere.

My student Mike Stay did computer science before he came
to UCR. When he was applying, he mentioned a result he
helped prove, which relates Goedel's theorem to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle:
    C. S. Calude and M. A. Stay, From Heisenberg to Goedel
    via Chaitin, International Journal of Theoretical Physics,
    44 (2005), 1053-1065. 
Now, this particular combination of topics is classic crackpot
fodder. People think "Gee, uncertainty sounds like incompleteness,
they're both limitations on knowledge - they must be
related!" and go off the deep end. So I got pretty suspicious
until I read his paper and saw it was CORRECT... at which
point I definitely wanted him around! The connection
they establish is not as precise as I'd like, but it's solid math.

From HN:
Money as a medium, from McLuhan's Understanding Media, as an encouragement to think of cryptocurrency as a medial paradigm shift...
“Money talks” because money is a metaphor, a transfer,
and a bridge. Like words and language, money is a storehouse
of communally achieved work, skill, and experience. Money,
however, is also a specialist technology like writing;
and as writing intensifies the visual aspect of speech
and order, and as the clock visually separates time from
space, so money separates work from the other social
functions. Even today money is a language for translating
the work of the farmer into the work of the barber, doctor,
engineer, or plumber. As a vast social metaphor, bridge,
or translator, money—like writing—speeds up exchange
and tightens the bonds of interdependence in any community.
It gives great spatial expansion and control to political
organizations, just as writing does, or the calendar.

Domain theory
-------------

"Domain Theory" Samson Abramsky and Achim Jung
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.353.463&rep=rep1&type=pdf

A *pointed* poset is a poset with a bottom: _|_ .

Definition 2.1.8. Let P be a poset. A subset A of P is directed, if it is nonempty and
each pair of elements of A has an upper bound in A.

Eg. chains (totally ordered non-empty subsets)
Eg. finite subsets of a set.

Definition 2.1.13. A poset D in which every directed subset has a supremum we call a
directed-complete partial order, or dcpo for short


Eg. The points of a locale form a dcpo in the specialization order, see [Vic89, Joh82].

Proposition 2.1.15. A partially ordered set D is a dcpo if and only if each chain in D
has a supremum. (uses axiom of choice)

Proposition 2.1.16. A pointed poset P is a dcpo if and only if every monotone map
on P has a least fixpoint.

Definition 2.1.17. Let D and E be dcpo’s. A function f : D → E is (Scott-) continuous
if it is monotone and if for each directed subset A of D we have f(↑A) = ↑f(A).
We denote the set of all continuous functions from D to E, ordered pointwise, by [D −→ E].

Proposition 2.1.18. Let D and E be dcpo’s. Then [D −→ E] is again a dcpo. Directed
suprema in [D −→ E] are calculated pointwise.


Definition 3.1.15. Let D and E be dcpo’s and let e: D → E and p: E → D be
continuous functions. We say that (e, p) is a continuous embedding projection pair (or
e-p-pair) if p ◦ e = idD and e ◦ p ⊑ idE.

Either of e or p determines the other.

Proposition 3.2.2. The cartesian product of dcpo’s is a dcpo. Suprema and infima are
calculated coordinatewise.

3.2.2 continuous functions on DCPO's:
    apply : [D −→ E] × D → E, <f, x> |-> f(x).
    curry : [D × E −→ F] -> [D −→ [E −→ F]].
    composition : [D −→ E]×[E −→ F] to [D −→ F]

Therefore DCPO is cartesian closed.

Definition 3.3.6
    A diagram { (D_n), e_mn : D_n -> D_m with n<=m } is an 
    *expanding sequence* if:
    1. each e_mn is an embedding (the associated projection is called p_nm.)
    2. e_nn = id
    3. e_kn = e_km o e_mn

Theorem 3.3.7
    limit (equals colimit) of expanding sequence {D_n, p_nm} ( {D_n, e_mn} ). 
    Call this the bilimit of D_n.


4. Cartesian closed categories of domains

5. Recursive domain equations

5.2 Construction of solutions

I is the one-point dcpo as discussed in Section 3.2.1
Let D stand for any category of pointed domains, closed under bilimits.

Solve:
    X ~= F(X)

Take (bi-)limit of the sequence I, F(I), F(F(I)), ...

Main Lemma 5.2.2.
Let F be a continuous functor on D^e (subcategory of D with embeddings only).
For each embedding e:A->F(A) consider the colimit <D, e_n> of the
expanding sequence 

   e       F(e)          F(F(e))
A --> F(A) ----> F(F(A)) -------> ...

Then D is isomorphic to F(D) via the maps

fold    = lim_n e_{n+1} o F(e_n)^*  :  F(D) -> D
unfold  = lim_n F(e_n) o e_{n+1}^*  :  D -> F(D)

(where f^* is the upper adjoint of f).

Also:
    F(e_n)  = unfold o e_{n+1}
    F(e_n)* = e_{n+1}^* o fold.


Starting with the initial embedding e:I->F(I) gives
the *canonical* solution to X~=F(X).



p-adic numbers
--------------

Let p be a prime number.
Z_p is the inverse limit of the finite rings Z/p^kZ
It has no zero divisors, so we can form the field of
fractions, denoted as Q_p, the field of p-adic numbers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number

Semantic domains & p-adic numbers?
Fail: Eg. no hom from GF(4)->GF(2).
GF(4) = Z/2Z[X]/(X^2+X+1) = {0, 1, X, X+1}.
No hom because GF has no solution to X^2+X+1.

We show, in great detail, how the perturbative tools
of quantum field theory allow one to rigorously obtain:
a ``categorified'' Faa di Bruno type formula for multiple
composition, an explicit formula for reversion and a
proof of Lagrange-Good inversion, all in the setting
of multivariable power series. We took great pains to
offer a self-contained presentation that, we hope, will
provide any mathematician who wishes, an easy access
to the wonderland of quantum field theory.

Modular forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modular group SL(2, Z).
A *modular form* of weight k for the modular group is 
    1. holomorphic function f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = (cz+d)^k f(z)
    3. holomorphic as z->i \infty

A *modular function* is
    1. meromorphic f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = f(z)
    3. meromorphic at the cusp (i \infty)

The space of modular forms of weight 2k has
dimension 1 for 2k = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14.
No (non-trivial) modular forms for odd weight.
No (non-trivial) modular forms weight k=2.


??? 
A modular function is a meromorphic function on H^/SL(2, Z),
where H^ includes the cusp i\infty (and all the other cusps..right?).


Eisenstein series for the modular group:

G_{2k}(z) = sum_{m, n \in Z, Z != 0}
    1 / (m + n z)^2k.

Defines a modular form of weight 2k, with k>=2 an integer.
Use weight 2k to get even weight otherwise
sumation cancels out to zero.
Sum does not converge for k==1.

Any modular form can be written as a polynomial in G_4 and G_6.
Specifically, there's a recurrence relation for the G's.

With E_2k = G_2k / (2 zeta(2k) )

we have the fourier series, q=e^{2\pi i z}:

    E_4 = 1 + 240 sum_n ( sigma_3(n) q^n )
    E_6 = 1 - 504 sum_n ( sigma_5(n) q^n )

where sigma_a(n) is the sum of the a'th powers of
the divisors of n.

Lambert series:

    sum_n ( sigma_a(n) q^n ) = sum_n ( n^a q^n / (1-q^n) )
        for |q|<=1 and any a.

A *cusp form* has zero coefficient for the q^0 term.

Ramanujan identities involve differentiating E_2, E_4, and E_6 :

q E_2' = (E_2^2 - E_4)/12
q E_4' = (E_2 E_4 - E_6)/3
q E_6' = (E_2 E_6 - E_4^2)/2.


j-invariant
~~~~~~~~~~~

Klein's j-invariant (or j function)
is the unique modular function $j$ such that:
    j(exp(2\pi i/3)) = 0, and
    j(i) = 1728.

Rational functions of $j$ give all
modular functions.

$j$ is a bijection between isomorphism classes
of elliptic curves (moduli space) and \Complex.

Moonshine
~~~~~~~~~

The q-expansion of $j$:

    j(q) = q^{-1} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 + ...

the coefficient of q^n
is the dimension of grade-n part of the moonshine module,
the first example being the Griess algebra,
which has dimension 196884.

The monster group was investigated in the 1970s
by mathematicians Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John
G. Thompson; they studied the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by subgroups of SL2(R), particularly, the normalizer
Γ0(p)+ of Γ0(p) in SL(2,R). They found that the Riemann
surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by Γ0(p)+ has genus zero if and only if p is 2,
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71.
When Ogg heard about the monster group later on, and
noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of
the size of M, he published a paper offering a bottle
of Jack Daniel's whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact.

collaborators) to be the unique holomorphic 
vertex operator algebra
with charge 24 and partition function j − 744 (where
j is again the modular invariant).



More generally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automorphic form:
    1. well behaved function f:G->C where G is a lie group
    2. invariant under a discrete subgroup gamma in G,
        up to a factor of automorphy.
    3. conditions on growth at infty

"The influence of Grothendieck on modern mathematics is virtually unpar-
alleled. If you ask who was the most important mathematician of the second
half of the twentieth century, many mathematicians will say without hesita-
tion: Grothendieck. Not only did he almost singlehandedly create modern al-
gebraic geometry, he also transformed the way we think about mathematics as
a whole."
Frenkel, in LOVE AND MATH, p157-158

"Though he was by no means a sloppy type, he was gifted with the special capability
of making many mistakes, mostly in the right direction. I envied him for this, and
tried in vain to imitate him, but found it quite difficult to make good mistakes."

"FINITE DIMENSIONAL HILBERT SPACES ARE COMPLETE FOR
DAGGER COMPACT CLOSED CATEGORIES" PETER SELINGER
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6972.pdf
Abstract. We show that an equation follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed
categories if and only if it holds in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 2.1:
A well-typed equation between morphisms in the language of dagger
compact closed categories follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed categories if and
only if it holds, up to graph isomorphism, in the graphical language.
(See: http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/dagger.pdf )
6. Generalizations
...the results also hold if one replaces k by the ring of Gaussian integers
k = Z[i].
In elementary terms: if a certain equation fails to hold in dagger compact closed
categories, then one can always find a counterexample in matrices with entries of the form
a+bi, where a, b ∈ Z. Moreover, i = √ −1 
can be replaced by √ d for any non-square integer d

I don't see why "understanding" is equivalent to mere
pattern recognition. Even using this word "recognition",
what does that mean? It's another word like "understand".
These algorithms are just pattern patterning. They don't
even know they are patterning, that is a meta-property
assigned in (or by) a context.

Subgroups of PSL(2,Z/7) and structure for klein's quartic:
http://library.msri.org/books/Book35/files/karcher.pdf
page 32-33:
    List of subgroups, assuming one fixed pairs of pants decomposition.
    Order 2: Rotation around the midpoint of a short edge interchanges the adjacent
    black and white hexagons; every white hexagon has a black image. There
    are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 3: Cyclic rotation of one pair of pants into itself; cyclic permutation of
    the other pants. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 6: The two symmetries just given combine to the full isotropy group of
    one pair of pants. The decomposition into hexagons by short edges is not
    determined. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: From the construction of the pants we know the cyclic group generated
    by two step translations of a closed geodesic made of short edges. The
    uncolored tiling is preserved. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: The 180◦-rotations around the twelve vertices of our pant hexagons
    form a Klein Four-group that preserves the colored tiling. There are 14 of
    these subgroups.
    Order 8: Extend the cyclic translation subgroup of order 4 by the 180◦ rotation
    around the midpoint of one of the translated short edges. This is the isotropy
    group of an eight step closed geodesic. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 12: The full invariance group of the colored tessellation contains in addition
    to the above Klein group the order 3 rotations of each of the pants.
    There are 14 of these subgroups.
    Order 24: All the above combine to the full invariance group of the uncolored
    tiling, abstractly this is the permutation group S4. There are 14 of these
    subgroups.
    Order 7: We know this as the invariance group of one heptagon. There are 8
    of these subgroups.
    Order 21: The invariance group of the tiling by 14 big triangles; no black and
    white triangles are interchanged; the isotropy of one triangle has order 3.
    There are 8 of these subgroups.

How complex systems fail

Mathematicians search for meaning,
physicists search for reality.

Meaning is intimately connected with subjectivity,
or point of view. 

The statement "there are three things" immediately illustrates
this: how many ways are there to view three things?

open up new _possibilities_ for mathematics."

Cauchy's theorem : if a prime p divides |G| then there
is a g in G of order p.
Proof: look at ordered p-tuples of group elements
(g_1,..,g_p) such that 
g_1 g2 ... g_p = 1.
There are |G|^{p-1} such tuples, which is a multple of p
when p divides |G|. 
Consider the action of Z/pZ on these p-tuples.
All the orbits of this action have size 1 or p 
(corresponding to the two subgroups of Z/pZ.)
The fixed points of this action are the constant p-tuples, ie g^p=1.
We have at least one fixed point for example when g=1.
Therefore there must be another fixed point.

from Toby Bartels:
https://plus.google.com/110399830759499718267

A (linear) isometry is precisely a linear operator T that satisfies
$T^* T = I$, while a co-isometry is precisely what
satisfies $T T^* = I$; a unitary operator is thus
precisely whatever is both.  Also, an isometry or co-isometry is
unitary iff it is invertible; thus, since an isometry is
necessary injective, a unitary operator is precisely a surjective isometry;
while a co-isometry is necessarily surjective, so a unitary operator
is precisely an injective co-isometry.

Projection onto a closed subspace is not just a good
example of a co-isometry but in some ways the canonical
example.  To be specific, if T: H -> K is
a co-isometry, then there is a unitary transformation U from K
to the closed subspace (ker T)^⊥ of H, and U
T is projection onto that subspace.  (U itself can be described
by saying that U* is the inclusion of (ker T)^⊥
followed by T, or equivalently that U* is the restriction
of T to (ker T)^⊥.)  Similarly, the canonical example of
an isometry is inclusion of a subspace; if T: H
-> K is an isometry, then there is a unitary
transformation U from H to the subspace im T of
K, and T U* is the inclusion map of this
subspace.  (U itself is T followed by projection onto im
T, or equivalently T with the codomain restricted to im T.)

"MARKOV CHAINS, R-TRIVIAL MONOIDS AND REPRESENTATION THEORY"
ARVIND AYYER, ANNE SCHILLING, BENJAMIN STEINBERG, AND NICOLAS M. THIERY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4250.pdf

A two-sided ideal of a monoid M is a non-empty subset I
such that MIM \subseteq I.
If I, J are ideals then IJ\subseteq I\cap J and so I\cap J is
non-empty.
Therefore every finite monoid has a unique minimal ideal.

Column monomial matrices are exactly the linear operators
induced by set mappings f:X->X.

Lemma 2.2: Every stochastic matrix is a convex combination of column
monomial matrices.

(This is very far from unique!)

Therefore:

Theorem 2.3. Every finite state Markov chain has a random mapping
representation.

Lemma 3.3: If M is a monoid whose minimal ideal b0 is a left zero
semigroup and if π is a probability on M with support contained in
b0, then π ∗ P = π for any probability P on M. In particular, π is
idempotent.

If a group G acts transitively on a set X,
and H is the stabilizer of x∈X, then gHg−1 is
the stabilizer of gx. Thus a normal subgroup has the
property that it leaves one x∈X invariant, then it leaves
every x∈X invariant.

The normalizer of H in G is the stabilizer subgroup of the conjugation
action of G on the set of conjugates of H.

Say your graph has nn nodes. Start out with nn identical 2-sided dice. Each having 0 on both sides will work fine.
Pick an arbitrary edge in the graph, specifying that DaDa should beat DbDb. All the dice currently have kk sides, and satisfy the requirements for previously added edges, and unconnected dice are even*. Find mm, the maximum of all the faces on the dice. To DaDa, add two faces with m+3m+3. To DbDb, add two faces of m+2m+2. To all other dice, add two faces, one of m+1m+1 and one of m+4m+4. Repeat this procedure for all edges in the graph, winding up with 2e+22e+2-sided dice.

When two systems, of which we know the states by
their respective representatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to
known forces between them, and when after a time of
mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no
longer be described in the same way as before, viz.
by endowing each of them with a representative of its
own. I would not call that one but rather the
characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its
entire departure from classical lines of thought.

this perhaps deserves it's own blog posting, but I am

where p is a permutation matrix  (acting on the variables
as basis elements of an n dimensional vector space.)

Generalizing this idea, we can define a ring of polynomials
f^G for any subgroup G of GL(n) as those polynomials fixed
by every element of G.

Questions:
    1. Find a set of generators of f^G. These are the "fundamental invariants."
    2. The relations among the fundamental invariants are called "syzygies."
    3. Write an arbitrary invariant as a polynomial in the fundamental invariants.
    4. Relate geometric properties with invariants and vice-versa.

Complex Reflection group
------------------------

A complex reflection (or pseudoreflection)
of a finite-dimensional complex vector
space V is an element of GL(V) of finite order that fixes
a complex hyperplane pointwise.
A subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections is
a complex reflection group.

All real reflection groups are also complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified
by G. C. Shephard and J. A. Todd (1954). They
found an infinite family G(m,p,n) depending on 3 positive integer
parameters (with p dividing m), and 34 exceptional cases.

Shephard and Todd proved that a finite group acting on 
a complex vector space is a complex reflection group 
if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring 
(Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem).

Truncated Braid Groups
----------------------

Given braid group B_n = <s_1,...,s_n>,
adjoin the relation s_i^k=1, for i=1,..,n.
These are the truncated braid groups B_n(k)

These groups are finite when 1/n + 1/k > 1/2,
for n>2 this corresponds to the five platonic solids.
In this case the order of the group is |1/2 V|^{n-1} n!
where V is the number of vertices of the platonic solid.

When 1/n + 1/k = 1/2 we get a tiling of the complex plane,
and when 1/n + 1/k < 1/2 it's the hyperbolic plane tiled
by regular n-gons with k polygons around each vertex.

These turn out to be complex reflection groups,
with complex reflections given by the s_i.

For algebraic proof of this:
"Factor groups of the braid group" Coxeter, 1957

"""
so the first point i want to emphasize here is that from everything
i've heard about the langlands program, it's supposed to be very
ambitious; thus for example somewhere in the above discussion someone
quotes the following statement from the paper "an elementary
introduction to the langlands program" by stephen gelbart:

"Herein lies the agony as well as the ecstasy of Langlands'
program. To merely state the conjectures requires much of the
machinery of class field theory, the structure theory of algebraic
groups, the representation theory of real and p-adic groups, and (at
least) the language of algebraic geometry. In other words, though the
promised rewards are great, the initiation process is forbidding."

we can turn gelbart's description here into a very rough superficial outline
of what we'd be working on:

1.  the galois-theoretic aspect of number theory (this is roughly what
gelbart means by so-called "class field theory").

2.  lots of kinds of group theory, including especially the study of
group representations of lots of kinds, but from a very
conceptual-geometric viewpoint.

3.  algebraic geometry, but from a very conceptual and
category-theoretic viewpoint unifying algebraic geometry with group
theory and kleinian geometry and mathematical logic.

4.  combining 1, 2, and 3 into the langlands program.

No finite field F is algebraically closed, 
because if a1, a2, ..., an are the elements of F, 
then the polynomial (x − a1)(x − a2) ··· (x − an) + 1

In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to
be more brilliant than I have gone on to become
distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty
five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve
done all things, often beautiful things in a context that
was already set out before them, which they had no
inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained
prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the
universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To
have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in
themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was
mine: The capacity to be alone.

to Quantum Information and Quantum Computer Scientists of the World Unite
As most of you probably know, the arXiv recently updated
its TeX engine to TexLive2016, and now expects the .bbl
file holding your references to be generated by biblatex in version 2.8.
Unfortunately the biblatex people (or whoever's responsible for that) keep
changing the format of the .bbl file. If you try
to upload an article to the arXiv and get one
of the following errors 'Package keyval Error: family_i undefined.' or 
'Package keyval Error: given_i undefined.',
it might be that you're using an older (and now incompatible) version of biblatex such
as 2.7 (which is e.g. the current version in an
up-to-date ubuntu distribution). A simple fix is to do a
search and replace in your .bbl file, changing every instance
of 'family_i' and 'given_i' to 'familyi' and 'giveni', respectively.
It cost me a good portion of my evening yesterday to
figure that out, so I thought I'd share this here
in case it saves someone some time and nerves.

"[I]f there is one thing in mathematics

else (and doubtless always has), it is
neither “number” nor “size”, but always
form. And among the thousand-andone
faces whereby form chooses to reveal
itself to us, the one that fascinates
me more than any other and continues
to fascinate me, is the structure hidden
in mathematical things."  Alexandre
Grothendieck, Récoltes et Semailles, page P27

What are the "atoms" of form?
Are these atoms "real", in the way a physicist
would use this word? 
Why would they not be real, if one can experience them?

Group theory, Kleinien geometry, the theory
of relativity: these are all about "point of view".
The consideration is this: that wich is true, must
be true from all points of view.
The problem with mathematical language is that it is
inherently point-of-view creating.

Rota's Basis Conjecture
-----------------------

Let B_1,...,B_n be a list of n bases of an n-dimensional vector space V 
(not necessarily distinct or disjoint). 
Then there exists an n*n grid of vectors (v_ij) such that:

1) the n vectors in row i are the members of the i'th basis B_i (in some order), and
2) in each column of the matrix, the n vectors in that column form a basis of V.

James: 
    and the solution path making the group solvable and thus making the
    quartic formula possible is: b,j,k,e,a.  (that is, each step amounts
    to a color-wheel decoration against the background of the accumulated
    previous decorations.)


subgroup I has "4 choose 2 == 6" conjugate subgroups
subgroup J has 3 conjugate subgroups

Concrete Groups and Axiomatic Theories I/II
Guest post by Todd Trimble
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/10/concrete_groups_and_axiomatic.html
https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/11/concrete_groups_and_axiomatic_1.html


From https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Klein+geometry :

"""
Then in (Klein 1872, end of section 5) it says:

    Suppose in space some group or other, the principal group
    for instance, be given. Let us then select a single
    configuration, say a point, or a straight line, or even
    an ellipsoid, etc., and apply to it all the transformations
    of the principal group. We thus obtain an infinite manifoldness
    with a number of dimensions in general equal to the
    number of arbitrary parameters contained in the group, but reducing
    in special cases, namely, when the configuration originally selected has
    the property of being transformed into itself by an infinite
    number of the transformations of the group. Every manifoldness generated
    in this way may be called, with reference to the generating group, a body.

This means in modern language, that if G is
the given group acting on a given space X,
and if S↪X is a given subspace
(a configuration), then the “body” generated by this is the
coset G/StabG(S) of G by the stabilizer subgroup
StabG(X) of that configuration. See also there at Stabilizer
of shapes – Klein geometry.

The text goes on to argue that spaces of this
form G/Stab_G(S) are of fundamental importance:

    If now we desire to base our investigations upon the
    group, selecting at the same time certain definite configurations as
    space-elements, and if we wish to represent uniformly things which
    are of like characteristics, we must evidently choose our space-elements
    in such a way that their manifoldness either is itself
    a body or can be decomposed into bodies.

I've been going through some math books that I bought many years ago and
now I find that I can start to make sense out of their contents.

In particular, John Conway's book "The sensual quadratic form" (1997). In the
first chapter he characterizes integer binary quadratic forms. It looks
to me like he is using an infinite Coxeter group to do this, because
the geometry involved looks like a polygon whose edges form an infinite tree.

It seems the group underlying this is PGL(2, Z), which is the symmetry group of
the two dimensional Z-module (aka lattice.)

Another good book, and full of examples, is "Classical Invariant Theory" by
Peter J. Olver (1999). He seems to be playing much the same game, but this time
over the real or complex field. I'm guessing that this material is the genesis
of algebraic geometry.

Anyway, I'm noticing how these examples are "contravariant" whereas
(so far) the geometric examples of group actions are "covariant". 
By this I mean, in geometric representation theory 
we have been looking at what objects
stay invariant under a group action, whereas in the algebra examples above
the polynomials *do* change under the group action, but we declare that
these are all equivalent polynomials, and then go on to characterize
this equivalence.

These two styles of using group theory really are duals of each other
in the category theory sense of "dual".

Another example of what I'm calling a covariant 
theory is the theory of symmetric functions: these are polynomials
that are *fixed* by a group. I've also been reading a bit about how
this theory is generalized to the other Coxeter groups.
This is explained in chapter 3 of James Humphreys book 
"Reflection Groups And Coxeter Groups", 1990.



Ah! One other very important example of what I am calling a 
"contravariant" theory is the ADE classification of 
simple singularities of a complex analytic function, due to V.I. Arnold.
This I understand very little of, but am quite interested as it relates
to braids and weyl groups and much more.
