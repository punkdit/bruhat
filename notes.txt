A Construction of Representations of Weyl Groups
T.A. Springer, 1978

    Let g be a complex semi-simple Lie algebra and A\in g a
    nilpotent element. Let G
    be the adjoint complex Lie group defined by g and denote
    by B_A^G the variety of Borel subgroups of G whose 
    Lie algebra contains A. Fix a maximal torus T of G
    and let W be its Weyl group. In this paper we shall construct
    representations of W in the graded cohomology H*(B_A^G, Q)

Why are the characters of the symmetric group integer-valued?
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/10635/
    The quickest answer is because all of the irreducible
    representations of the symmetric group can be constructed
    over the field of rational numbers. See the wikipedia
    article on Young symmetrizers for example 
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_symmetrizer
    
    More generally, one can say that representations of any
    finite Weyl group can be constructed over the rational
    numbers. This is explained in one of Springer's papers:
    http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=491988
    
    Another reason is that one write down an explicit combinatorial
    formula for the values of these characters. This is the
    Murnaghan-Nakayama rule and can be found in many sources.
    One such source is Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics
    volume 2, Section 7.17, and Section 7.18 for its connection
    to the symmetric group.

    This points to an unusual property of symmetric groups
    and other Weyl groups which is much stronger than the
    fact that their characters take values in $\mathbb{Z}$:
    the representing matrices can actually be written over
    $\mathbb{Q}$. Of course, the price of this stronger statement
    is doing more work than just showing that character values
    (always algebraic integers) are rational

On Klein’s Icosahedral Solution of the Quintic
Oliver Nash
    From one point of view, the exceptional geometry of the
    quintic is a result of the exceptional isomorphism:
    A5 ~= P SL(2, 5)
    Corresponding to the exact sequence defining the level-5
    principal congruence subgroup of the modular group:
    0 → Γ(5) → P SL(2, Z) → P SL(2, 5) → 0
    there is a factorization of the modular quotient:
    j : H ∗ j5 −→ X(5) Iˆ −→ X(1)

“A motive is supposed to come with a product of l-adic
Galois representations, whose Frobenius eigenvalues would
be related to Hecke eigenvalues by reciprocity?” Arthur
wrote. “But could we not argue that the latter are closely
related to quantum mechanics-like spectra, being ‘momentum
observables’ in the sense that they commute with the
Laplacian/Hamiltonian?” -- Jim Arthur

Numerical and analytical bounds on threshold error rates for hypergraph-product codes
Alexey A. Kovalev, Sanjay Prabhakar, Ilya Dumer, Leonid P. Pryadko
    we analyze numerically the low-disorder
    portion of the phase diagram of the two random-bond
    Ising models corresponding to the ML decoding of (3, 4)
    QHP codes with i.i.d. bit-flip errors. For a CSS code with
    generators G = Gx and H = Gz, the corresponding Ising
    models have the free energies Fe(G; K) and Fe(H∗ ; K),
    see Eqs. (4) and (15), where e is the binary error vector
    whose non-zero bits indicate the flipped bonds, and
    K = 1/T is the inverse temperature. These models, respectively,
    correspond to the numerator and the denominator
    of the conditional ML decoding probability (5).

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph
    Every group character \chi of the group
    G induces an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of 
    \Gamma (G,S). The associated eigenvalue is 
    \lambda_{\chi }=\sum_{s\in S}\chi(s)
Really??? I think this is only true for abelian G.

Obituary for a Flea

(Submitted on 18 Oct 2016)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06093
    The Landsman-Reuvers proposal to solve the measurement
    problem from within quantum theory is extensively analysed.
    In favor of proposals of this kind, it is shown that
    the standard reasoning behind objections to solving the
    measurement problem from within quantum theory rely on
    counterfactual reasoning or mathematical idealisations.
    Subsequently, a list of objections/challenges to the
    proposal are made. Part of these objections are equally
    important for all attempts at solving the measurement
    problem, such as the problem of interpreting small numbers
    in the density matrix, the problem of reproducing the
    Born rule, the use of pure states as a tool to alleviate
    the interpretational issues of quantum states, and the
    necessity of introducing classical certainties which
    are not strictly present in quantum theory. The additional
    objections that are particular to the proposal, such
    as the physical interpretation/origin of the flea perturbation,
    the use of potentials to solve a dynamical problem, slow
    collapse times, the inability to handle unequal probabilities,
    and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead
    us to believe that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking
    in both physical grounding and theoretical promise. Finally,
    an overview is given of the challenges that were encountered
    in this attempt to solve the measurement problem from
    within quantum theory.

> Hi Simon,

> process, I thought it might be nice to work out on the side some things
> which we've learned from Jim (maybe you've done this already).

Yes, I'm very keen. I did a bunch of calculations of Burnside rings of
finite groups. Actually I wrote programs that did the calculations.
This was quite interesting, and closely related to this Gram-Schmidt
process.

One concrete question I have is regarding the dihedral group of order 8, 
which I will call B_2.
The treatment on the nLab focuses on the symmetric groups and the G-sets
coming from parabolic subgroups. There are other (stabilizer)
subgroups apart from these, and I found with B_2 that I could just use
all of the subgroups (up to conjugacy) when building the M matrix.

Then after row reduction, this matrix ends up with some zero rows, but
still manages to record the irreducibles in each permutation representation.

Maybe I'm not being very clear, so let me give some details.

There are 8 subgroups of B_2 up to conjugacy, and
here they are labelled A through H, along with a description of the 
corresponding "structure" stabilized:

    A order = 8, stabilizes nothing
    B order = 4, stabilizes a short axis
    C order = 4, stabilizes a long axis
    D order = 4, stabilizes an orientation
    E order = 2, stabilizes a corner
    F order = 2, stabilizes an edge
    G order = 2, stabilizes an opposite (unordered) pair of flags
    H order = 1, stabilizes a flag.

This description is with respect to the usual action on a square.
A flag is an incident corner and edge.
Each of E and F are conjugate to another subgroup, I think this
has something to do with the stabilizer of a corner also stabilizing
the opposite corner.
The subgroups E and F are the only subgroups that have conjugate subgroups. 

We can multiply (tensor) the corresponding permutation representations,
and there's a boatload of ways of describing this multiplication,
double cosets being one of them. James likes to talk about "geometric
relationships". 

So here is the multiplication table for B_2:

  | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
--+----------------------------
A | A B  C  D  E    F    G  H  
B | B 2B G  G  2E   H    2G 2H 
C | C G  2C G  H    2F   2G 2H 
D | D G  G  2D H    H    2G 2H 
E | E 2E H  H  2E+H 2H   2H 4H 
F | F H  2F H  2H   2F+H 2H 4H 
G | G 2G 2G 2G 2H   2H   4G 4H 
H | H 2H 2H 2H 4H   4H   4H 8H 

If we just count the double cosets we get this:

  | A B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
A | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
B | 1  2  1  1  2  1  2  2  
C | 1  1  2  1  1  2  2  2  
D | 1  1  1  2  1  1  2  2  
E | 1  2  1  1  3  2  2  4  
F | 1  1  2  1  2  3  2  4  
G | 1  2  2  2  2  2  4  4  
H | 1  2  2  2  4  4  4  8  

After row reduction:

  | A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
--+-------------------------
V | 1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  
W | .  1  .  .  1  .  1  1  
X | .  .  1  .  .  1  1  1  
Y | .  .  .  1  .  .  1  1  
Z | .  .  .  .  1  1  .  2  

I got rid of the zero rows,
and the leftover rows are labelled by the irreducible representations.

As we see from the H column, B_2 has four 1-dimensional
irreducible representations, and one 2-dimensional irreducible representation.

I guess my second question is, how can we just blithly add and
subtract double cosets...? 

> As a computational side note: if the permutation representation P attached

> Q> can be represented as having a basis Stab(c) \ G / Stab(d)  consisting
> of double cosets.

This seems to have something to do with my question. Perhaps I just
need to do some more examples. My understanding of the usual representation
theory is not great, but it seems that the way they would normally
"kill off" a part of a reducible representation involves a summation
over the elements of the group while multiplying by a character
Something like that. (i really don't understand this very well.)
So I'm wondering if that is going on here aswell, "under the hood".

How to Draw a Group
Alexander Zvonkin
    Abstract
    A map is at the same time a group. To represent a map (that
    is, a graph drawn on the sphere or on another surface) we usually
    use a pair of permutations on the set of the \ends" of edges. These
    permutations generate a group which we call a cartographic group.
    The main motivation for the study of the cartographic group is the
    so-called theory of \dessins d'enfants" of Grothendieck, which relates
    the theory of maps to Galois theory [24].
    In the present paper we address the questions of identifying the
    cartographic group for a given map, and of constructing the maps
    with a given cartographic group

    Theorem: The group of rotations of the icosahedron is
    of order 60, simple, and isomorphic to the alternating
    group A5. Therefore, A5 is simple.

    icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges and 20 faces.

    The compound of 5 octahedra: Consider the construction
    of three orthogonal golden rectangles inscribed in the
    icosahedron. The six short sides are edges of the icosahedron,
    and we can paint them with the same color. Observe that,
    whenever an edge e is chosen, there is a unique way
    to build the rectangles in such a way that the edge e
    is one of the short sides, so in this way the 30 edges
    can be painted with 5 different colors. The midpoints
    of the edges of each color are the vertices of an octahedron,
    so we have formed a compound of 5 octahedra.

    the step size parameter. Each term in a Butcher series
    consists of a weighted elementary differential, and the
    set of all such differentials is isomorphic to the set
    of rooted trees, as noted by Cayley in the mid 19th century.
    A century later Butcher discovered that rooted trees
    can also be used to obtain the order conditions of Runge-Kutta
    methods, and he found a natural group structure, today
    known as the Butcher group. It is now known that many
    numerical methods also can be expanded in Butcher series;
    these are called B-series methods. A long-standing problem
    has been to characterize, in terms of qualitative features,
    all B-series methods. Here we tell the story of Butcher
    series, stretching from the early work of Cayley, to
    modern developments and connections to abstract algebra,
    and finally to the resolution of the characterization
    problem. This resolution introduces geometric tools and
    perspectives to an area traditionally explored using
    analysis and combinatorics.

"Spectral gaps of frustration-free spin systems with boundary"
Marius Lemm, Evgeny Mozgunov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08915.pdf
"""
A central question concerning a quantum many-body system is whether it
is gapped or gapless. (By definition, a system is “gapped” if the difference
between the two lowest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian remains uniformly
bounded away from zero in the thermodynamic limit. Otherwise, it is gapless.)
    The importance of this concept stems from the fact that ground states
of gapped systems enjoy many useful properties. For instance, they display
exponential decay of correlations [28]. In one dimension, more is known: The
ground states satisfy an area law for the entanglement entropy [2, 17] and
can be well approximated in polynomial time [3, 21]. Moreover, the closing
of the spectral gap (as a parameter in the Hamiltonian is varied) indicates a
quantum phase transition, and is therefore related to topological order, e.g.,
via the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem [16, 23]. To summarize, the existence of
a spectral gap is a fortunate occurrence that has far-reaching consequences
for low-temperature physics. (It is also rare in a probabilistic sense [24].)
    It is well-known that the existence of a spectral gap may depend on the
imposed boundary conditions, and this fact is at the core of our work.
    In general, the question whether a quantum spin system is gapped or
gapless is difficult: In 1D, the Haldane conjecture [14, 15] (“antiferromagnetic,
integer-spin Heisenberg chains are gapped”) remains open after 30
years of investigation. In 2D, the “gapped versus gapless” dichotomy is in
fact undecidable in general [10], even among the class of translation-invariant,
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians

Hodge Laplacians on Graphs
Lek-Heng Lim
    Abstract. This is an elementary introduction to the Hodge Laplacian on a
    graph, a higher-order generalization of the graph Laplacian. We will discuss
    basic properties including cohomology and Hodge theory. At the end we will
    also discuss the nonlinear Laplacian on a graph, a nonlinear generalization of
    the graph Laplacian as its name implies. These generalized Laplacians will be
    constructed out of coboundary operators, i.e., discrete analogues of exterior
    derivatives. The main feature of our approach is simplicity — this article
    requires only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory.

Towers of generalized divisible quantum codes
Jeongwan Haah
Sep 27 2017 quant-ph arXiv:1709.08658v1
    A divisible binary classical code is one in which every
    code word has weight divisible by a fixed integer. If
    the divisor is 2ν for a positive integer ν, then one
    can construct a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, where
    X-stabilizer space is the divisible classical code,
    that admits a transversal gate in the ν-th level of
    Clifford hierarchy. We consider a generalization of the
    divisibility by allowing a coefficient vector of odd
    integers with which every code word has zero dot product
    modulo the divisor. In this generalized sense, we construct
    a CSS code with divisor 2ν+1 and code distance d
    from any CSS code of code distance d and divisor 2ν
    where the transversal X is a nontrivial logical operator.
    The encoding rate of the new code is approximately d
    times smaller than that of the old code. In particular,
    for large d and ν≥2, our construction yields a CSS
    code of parameters [[O(dν−1),Ω(d),d]]
    admitting a transversal gate at the ν-th level of Clifford
    hierarchy. For our construction we introduce a conversion
    from magic state distillation protocols based on Clifford
    measurements to those based on codes with transversal
    T-gates. Our tower contains, as a subclass, generalized
    triply even CSS codes that have appeared in so-called
    gauge fixing or code switching methods.

Eilenberg–MacLane spaces
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology#Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_spaces
    There is a related description of the first cohomology
    with coefficients in any abelian group A, say for a CW
    complex X. Namely, H1(X,A) is in one-to-one correspondence
    with the set of isomorphism classes of Galois covering
    spaces of X with group A, also called principal A-bundles
    over X. For X connected, it follows that H1(X,A) is isomorphic
    to Hom(π1X,A), where π1X is the fundamental group of
    X. For example, H1(X,Z/2) classifies the double covering
    spaces of X, with the element 0 ∈ H1(X,Z/2) corresponding
    to the trivial double covering, the disjoint union of
    two copies of X.

    are the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of M.


"ZETA FUNCTIONS OF GRAPHS"
Graph theory meets number theory in this stimulating book. Ihara zeta functions of
finite graphs are reciprocals of polynomials, sometimes in several variables. Analogies
abound with number-theoretic functions such as Riemann or Dedekind zeta functions.
For example, there is a Riemann hypothesis (which may be false) and a prime number
theorem for graphs. Explicit constructions of graph coverings use Galois theory to
generalize Cayley and Schreier graphs. Then non-isomorphic simple graphs with the
same zeta function are produced, showing that you cannot “hear” the shape of a graph.
The spectra of matrices such as the adjacency and edge adjacency matrices of a
graph are essential to the plot of this book, which makes connections with quantum
chaos and random matrix theory and also with expander and Ramanujan graphs, of
interest in computer science. Pitched at beginning graduate students, the book will also
appeal to researchers. Many well-chosen illustrations and exercises, both theoretical
and computer-based, are included throughout.

Galois theorem (roughly):
    let Y be an (unramified) normal covering of X
    with Galois group G=G(Y/X).
    Then intermediate graphs correspond bijectively to
    subgroups of G, and subgroup inclusion H1<=H2 corresponds to
    covering Y>=Y1>=Y2>=X.

    A ``prime'' [C] in X is an equivalence class of primitive
    closed backtrackless, tailless cycles C such that C!=D^m, m>=2 and D a
    path in X. For brevity, we will sometimes refer to primitive closed
    backtrackless tailless cycles C as prime cycles.

Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics

p132:
"""
both the Desargues graph
and the dodecahedron graph are double covers of the Petersen graph.
For a labeled graph, each double cover corresponds uniquely to an
element of the Z/2Z cohomology of the graph (for an unlabeled
graph, some of the double covers defined in this way may turn out
to be isomorphic). Cohomology over Z/2Z takes any cycle as input
and returns either 0 or 1, in a consistent way (the output of a Z/2Z
sum of cycles is the sum of the outputs on each cycle). The double
cover has two copies of everything in the base (Petersen) graph, and
as you follow all the way around a cycle in the base, the element of
cohomology tells you whether you come back to the same copy (for
0) or the other copy (for 1) in the double cover, compared to where
you started.
One well-defined double cover for any graph is the one which simply
switches copies for every single edge (this corresponding to the ele-
ment of cohomology which is 1 on all odd cycles and 0 on all even
cycles). This always gives a double cover which is a bipartite graph,
and which is connected if and only if the base graph is connected
and not bipartite.

https://www.quora.com/What-is-virtual-representation

We can force this subtraction to always make sense by
considering a weaker notion of equivalence of representations
than isomorphism. The Grothendieck group K0(G) of
representations of G is the free abelian group on isomorphism
classes of representations of G, modulo the relation that

[V]=[U]+[W] if V≅U⊕W

When X is a representation, we write [X] for its
class in the Grothendieck group. Because of this definition,
there are symbols such as −[X] in K0(G). But
there is no guarantee that there is any representation
YY such that [Y]=−[X] (in fact, for nice enough
groups and X,Y≠0, this never happens).

To answer the original question: a virtual representation
is an element of K0(G) that is not (necessarily)
the class of a representation of G.

    There are many uses of the word ‘spectrum’ in mathematics,
    and most of them are related. 
    In particular, the spectrum of a linear operator on a
    finite-dimensional vector space — that is, its set of
    eigenvalues — can be seen as the spectrum of an associated
    commutative ring.

    Let T:V->V be a linear operator on V with minimal
    polynomial m(x).
    End(V) is the k-algebra of linear operators on V.
    the homomorphism f:k[x]->End(V) sending x to T has
    kernel (m(x)) and image the subalgebra of End(V) 
    generated by T.
    So k[x]/(m(x)) is isomorphic to this subalgebra.

    perturbations of T lift the degeneracy of
    the eigenvalues, so that m(x) is the characteristic polynomial...

    the characteristic polynomial is the “continuous minimum polynomial”.

Let B be a finite type C-algebra.
Then B = C[x1, ..., xn]/(f1, ..., fk)
and Spec B is the variety cut out of C^n by f1,...,fk.

    The category of compact Hausdorff spaces is equivalent
    to the opposite category of C∗-algebras. 
    The category of totally-disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces
    is equivalent to the opposite category of Boolean algebras.
    
     if R is a commutative-ring type object in some category
    of geometric objects, and X is a geometric object carrying
    a sufficient supply of maps to R, then it is worthwhile
    to look at the ring of functions from X to R, as this
    object will carry a lot of information on X. In the
    other direction, it is often useful to study commutative-ring
    objects by trying to realize them as rings of functions
    on some geometric object, their "spectrum". However,
    even with this in mind, it is still quite striking that
    this approach yields so many anti-equivalences between
    full subcategories of geometric objects and full subcategories
    of commutative-algebraic objects. It is like the geometer/topologist/homotopy-theorist
    is walking on one continent, and the commutative-algebraist
    is walking on another, and yet they keep stumbling upon
    the exact same species of categories (only in reverse).

    ~~~~~~~

    Note that topological spaces are already very nearly
    defined to be dual to certain commutative algebra-like
    structures, namely their frames of open subsets. The
    simplest interesting case of this duality is a duality
    between finite sets and finite Boolean rings / algebras.
    One way to think about this conceptually is that the
    open subsets of a topological space axiomatize verifiable
    or semidecidable properties of a point in that space:
    that is, properties such that if they hold you can check
    that that's true, but such that if they don't hold you
    can't necessarily check that that's true. See this math.SE
    question for more discussion on this point. For example,
    the open sets in the product topology on {0,1}N{0,1}N
    correspond precisely to those properties of an infinite
    sequence of zeroes and ones that you can verify by looking
    at finitely many terms of the sequence. (Once we agree
    that verifiable properties are a cool thing to look at,
    we should also agree that we care about logical operations
    on them, like AND and OR, and this is where the commutative
    algebra-like structure comes from.)

    Why is FinSet so important, anyway? Well, one categorical
    property that categories of spaces often share that isn't
    true in general is that binary products tend to distribute
    over binary coproducts. This is true in particular in
    any cartesian closed category, such as Set, and any
    category with this property behaves in some sense like
    a categorified commutative ring (!). It turns out that
    FinSet is the free distibutive category on a point.

    ~~~~~~~~

    All these five equivalences Cop≃DCop≃D follow the following
    pattern: There is an object PP which, in some sense,
    belongs to both CC and DD. More precisely, there are
    objects PC∈CPC∈C and PD∈DPD∈D which are "similar" in
    the sense that for example they share the same underlying
    set, maybe more. Moreover, the hom-functor hom(−,PC)hom⁡(−,PC)
    lifts to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PC):Cop→D,
    
    hom_(−,PC):Cop→D,
    and likewise hom(−,PD)hom⁡(−,PD) to a functor
    hom–––––(−,PD):D→Cop.
    hom_(−,PD):D→Cop.
    Then in most examples it is rather easy to construct
    an adjunction between these functors, since unit and
    counit may be defined as "evaluation"
    X→hom–––––(hom–––––(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    X→hom_(hom_(X,P),P),x↦(f↦f(x)).
    For more details, see the nlab article on dualizing objects.
    This is the purely formal part. The nontrivial part is
    to determine the fixed objects of this adjunction. If
    we are lucky, every object is a fixed object, so that
    Cop≃DCop≃D. But often, we have to shrink CC and DD further.
    
    
    In Gelfand duality (2), P=CP=C "is" both an object of
    TopTop and of ∗Alg∗Alg (unital ∗∗-algebras), and the
    Gelfand spectrum
    hom–––––∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    hom_∗Alg(−,C):∗Alg→Topop
    is left adjoint to the function algebra
    hom–––––Top(−,C):Topop→∗Alg.



https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35629/how-is-representation-theory-used-in-modular-automorphic-forms
    the basic link to representation theory is that modular
    forms (and automorphic forms) can be viewed as functions
    in representation spaces of reductive groups. What I
    mean is the following: take for example a modular form,
    i.e. a function ff on the upper-half plane satisfying
    certain conditions. Since the upper-half plane is a quotient
    of G=GL(2,R)G=GL(2,R), you can pull ff back to a function
    on GG (technically you massage it a bit, but this is
    the main idea) which will be invariant under a discrete
    subgroup ΓΓ. Functions that look like this are called
    automorphic forms on GG. The space all automorphic forms
    on GG is a representation of GG (via the right regular
    represenation, i.e. (gf)(x)=f(xg)(gf)(x)=f(xg)). Basically,
    any irreducible subrepresentation of the space of automorphic
    forms is what is called an automorphic representation
    of GG. So, modular forms can be viewed as certain vectors
    in certain (generally infinite-dimensional) representations
    of GG. In this context, one can define the Hecke algebra
    of GG as the complex-valued C∞C∞ functions on GG with
    compact support viewed as a ring under convolution. This
    is a substitute for the group ring that occurs in the
    representation theory of finite groups, i.e. the (possibly
    infinite-dimensional) group representations of GG should
    correspond to the (possibly infinite-dimensional) algebra
    representations of its Hecke algebra. This type of stuff
    is the basic connection of modular forms to representation
    theory and it goes back at least to Gelfand–Graev–Piatestkii-Shapiro's
    Representation theory and automorphic functions. You
    can replace GG with a general reductive group.

    A modular form is a highest weight vector of a discrete

    D) the classification of simple singularities
    E) the classification of tame quivers

    It's really interesting to study the "Grothendieck group"
    K(A) of an abelian category A. As a set, this consists
    of formal linear combinations of isomorphism classes
    of objects of A, where we impose the relations
    
    [a] + [b] = [x]
    
    whenever we have a short exact sequence
    
    0 → a → x → b → 0
    
    It becomes an abelian group in an obvious way.
    
    For example, if A is the category of representations
    of some group G, it's an abelian category and K(A) is
    called the "representation ring" of A - it's a ring because
    we tensor representations. Or, if A is the category of
    vector bundles over a space X, it's again abelian, and
    K(A) is called the "K-theory of X".


A Rapid Introduction to ADE Theory
John McKay
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/ADE.html
    To get the other Dynkin graphs, we "fold" these ones
    (the ADE Dynkin graphs, these are the affine Dynkin graphs)
    by replacing nodes by the equivalence classes of nodes
    under orbits of graph automorphisms. There are several
    ways of doing this. Repeated folding and reversing arrows
    and unfolding, yields, for example, the sequence: D4
    - G2 - E6 - F4 - E7. One may interpret the reversals
    in terms of Frobenius reciprocity.
    ...
    
    They are also being used in finding the spectral lines
    associated with the newly discovered C60 molecules of
    fullerenes. This provides a good example of the unity
    of mathematics and the nonsense of the distinction between
    pure and applied.

    Every (associative, unital) ring is a subring of the
    endomorphism ring of its underlying additive group. Rings
    act on abelian groups; groups act on sets. The universal
    action on an abelian group is its endomorphism ring;
    the universal action on a set is the symmetric group.
    Modules are rings that remember their action on an abelian
    group; permutation groups are groups that remember their
    action on a set. (Jack Schmidt)

    You can think of Cayley's theorem as the special case
    of Yoneda's lemma, where the category has only one object.
    If you take the additive version of Yoneda's lemma, and
    you plug in an additive category with one object then
    you get the desired statement for rings that's in Jack's
    answer. Viewing Cayley's theorem like this let's you
    generalize it to many other structures then groups.

    As people have said, non-commutative rings are naturally
    endomorphisms of abelian groups. The first non-commutative
    ring people should have in their head should be M_n, I think.
    
    However, I'm surprised no one has brought up that commutative
    rings are naturally the set of functions on something.
    Granted, it takes a couple of semesters of algebraic
    geometry to make this true, but its the idea that motivates
    the theory. The first commutative ring people should
    have in their head is C[x], with Z as a second example
    where it seems tantalyzingly bizarre that everything
    still works (prime factorization, ideals, etc). Certainly,
    when I try to convince a skeptic that rings are awesome
    (which I have done a couple of times now), I wave my
    hands wildly and talk about how cool rings of functions
    on things are.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19857/has-decidability-got-something-to-do-with-primes
    Goedel did indeed use the Chinese remainder theorem in
    his proof of the Incompleteness theorem. This was used
    in what you describe as the `boring' part of the proof,
    the arithmetization of syntax. Contemporary researchers
    often agree with your later assessment, however, that
    the arithmetization of syntax is profound. This is the
    part of the proof that reveals the self-referential nature
    of elementary number theory, for example, since in talking
    about numbers we can in effect talk about statements
    involving numbers. Ultimately, we arrive in this way
    at a sentence that asserts its own unprovability, and
    this gives the Incompleteness Theorem straight away.
    
    But there are other coding methods besides the Chinese
    Remainder theorem, and not all of them involve primes
    directly. For example, the only reason Goedel needed
    CRT was that he worked in a very limited formal language,
    just the ring theory language. But one can just as easily
    work in a richer language, with all primitive recursive
    functions, and the proof proceeds mostly as before, with
    a somewhat easier time for the coding part, involving
    no primes. Other proofs formalize the theory in the hereditary
    finite sets HF, which is mutually interpreted with the
    natural numbers N, and then the coding is fundamentally
    set-theoretic, also involving no primes numbers especially.

Let GG be a semi-simple Lie group, let KK be its maximal
compact subgroup, let ΓΓ be a discrete subgroup of GG,
and form G/K.G/K. This quotient is called the symmetric
space attached to GG.

The Riemanian structure comes from an invariant metric on
GG, and so GG acts as isometries on G/KG/K by left translation.

If you consider the case G=SL2(R)G=SL2(R), you get SL2(R)/SO(2)SL2(R)/SO(2),
which is naturally identified with the complex upper
half-plane (on which SL2(R)SL2(R) acts via Mobius transformations;
note that the point ii is stablized precisely by SO(2)SO(2)),
which is also the hyperbolic plane. Other groups give
higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces (e.g. SL2(C)SL2(C)
gives hyperbolic 33-space), the Siegel upper half-spaces
(from symplectic groups), complex balls, and many other
well-known spaces.

If you now take a discrete subgroup ΓΓ of GG, you can
form the double quotient Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K. These are some of
the most celebrated Riemannian manifolds in mathematics.
In the case of SL2(R)SL2(R), we know via uniformization
that all genus ≥2≥2 Riemann surfaces can be described
in this way. In the case of SL2(C)SL2(C) we get hyperbolic
33-manifolds, from symplectic groups we get moduli spaces
of abelian varieties, ... .

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces Γ∖G/KΓ∖G/K
for certain ΓΓ (so-called congruence subgroups) is one
of the basic topics of the Langlands program, and the
function theory and cohomology of these spaces (especially
their representation-theoretic structure) is conjectured
to govern a vast amount of number theory. Trying to understand
and work on these conjectures was my own motivation for
learning Lie theory.

The Poincaré half-plane for informationally complete POVMs
Michel Planat
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06768
    It has been shown that classes of (minimal asymmetric)
    informationally complete POVMs in dimension d can be
    built using the multiparticle Pauli group acting on appropriate
    fiducial states [M. Planat and Z. Gedik, R. Soc. open
    sci. 4, 170387 (2017)]. The latter states may also be
    derived starting from the Poincar\'e upper half-plane
    model H. For doing this, one translates the congruence
    (or non-congruence) subgroups of index d of the modular
    group into groups of permutation gates whose some of
    the eigenstates are the seeked fiducials. The structure
    of some IC-POVMs is found to be intimately related to
    the Kochen-Specker theorem.

Interpretation of quantum mechanics with indefinite norm

    The Born postulate can be reduced to its deterministic
    content that only applies to eigenvectors of observables:

A Completely Top-Down Hierarchical Structure in Quantum Mechanics
Yakir Aharonov, Eliahu Cohen, Jeff Tollaksen
    (Submitted on 20 Sep 2017)
    Can a large system be fully characterized using its subsystems
    via inductive reasoning? Is it possible to completely
    reduce the behavior of a complex system to the behavior
    of its simplest "atoms"? In the following paper we answer
    these questions on the negative for a specific class
    of systems and measurements. We begin with simple two-particle
    example, where strong correlations arise between two
    apparently empty boxes. This leads to new surprising
    effects within atomic and electromagnetic systems. A
    general construction based on pre- and post-selected
    ensembles is then suggested, where the N-body correlation
    can be genuinely perceived as a global property, as long
    as one is limited to preforming a small set of measurements
    which we term "strictly local". We conclude that within
    time-symmetric quantum mechanics and under certain boundary
    conditions, high-order correlations can determine low-order
    ones, but not vice versa. Moreover, the latter seem to
    provide no information at all regarding the former. This
    supports a top-down structure in many-body quantum mechanics.


Introduction to Quantum Logical Information Theory
David Ellerman
    (Submitted on 15 Jul 2017 (v1), last revised 17 Aug 2017 (this version, v2))
    Logical information theory is the quantitative version
    of the logic of partitions just as logical probability
    theory is the quantitative version of the dual Boolean
    logic of subsets. The resulting notion of information
    is about distinctions, differences, and distinguishability,
    and is formalized as the distinctions of a partition
    (a pair of points distinguished by the partition). All
    the definitions of simple, joint, conditional, and mutual
    entropy of Shannon information theory are derived by
    a uniform transformation from the corresponding definitions
    at the logical level. The purpose of this paper is to
    give the direct generalization to quantum logical information
    theory that similarly focuses on the pairs of eigenstates
    distinguished by an observable, i.e., qubits of an observable.
    The fundamental theorem for quantum logical entropy and
    measurement establishes a direct quantitative connection
    between the increase in quantum logical entropy due to
    a projective measurement and the eigenstates (cohered
    together in the pure superposition state being measured)
    that are distinguished by the measurement (decohered
    in the post-measurement mixed state). Both the classical
    and quantum versions of logical entropy have simple interpretations
    as "two-draw" probabilities. The conclusion is that quantum
    logical entropy is the simple and natural notion of information
    for a quantum information theory focusing on the distinguishing
    of quantum states.

Cohomological Induction and Unitary Representations
Anthony W. Knapp and David A . Vogan, Jr.
(scary book)

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Abstract-Homotopy.pdf

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1534/induction-and-coinduction-of-representations

    If you have any homomorphism f: H -> G, you get a restriction
    functor f* on representations, but the existence of adjoints
    depends on the existence of certain limits, in particular,
    how large you allow representations to be. Formally,
    you get an induction f! that takes V to the tensor product
    over group algebras (or a fiber product with G if you're
    working with G-sets or G-spaces) which is infinite dimensional
    if G/f(H) is infinite. Similarly, the coinduction f*
    takes V to H-module homomorphisms from the group algebra
    of G to V (or H-equivariant maps from G). This also works
    for Lie algebras and algebraic groups without significant
    alteration - when working with Lie algebras you use the
    universal enveloping algebras in place of group rings.
    If your groups, algebras, and representations come with
    smooth/algebraic/topological structure, then the definition
    gets more complicated due to completions, etc.
    
    There is a fancy way to view representations as sheaves on
    a classifying stack BG, so the homomorphism f describes
    a pointed map BH -> BG, and the upper and lower stars
    and shrieks correspond to the usual sheaf operations.
    Sometimes people use derived versions of these functors,
    and apparently get useful results (although I don't recall
    any of them in particular). The induction operation can
    be thought of as a pushforward with proper (compact)
    supports while coinduction is a plain pushforward. A
    coinduced module tends to be "bigger", e.g., if you start
    with the trivial representation of the trivial group,
    the coinduced representation is the dual of the induced
    representation. Induction may use half-forms on fibers
    of a map, since the product of two half-forms is a volume
    and can be integrated along fibers to get functions on
    the target.


Modal quantum theory
https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2929
    We present a discrete model theory similar in structure
    to ordinary quantum mechanics, but based on a finite
    field instead of complex amplitudes. The interpretation
    of this theory involves only the "modal" concepts of
    possibility and necessity rather than quantitative probability
    measures. Despite its simplicity, our model theory includes
    entangled states and has versions of both Bell's theorem
    and the no cloning theorem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer's_theorem_on_induced_characters
    Using Frobenius reciprocity, Brauer's induction theorem
    leads easily to his fundamental characterization of characters,
    which asserts that a complex-valued class function of
    G is a virtual character if and only if its restriction
    to each Brauer elementary subgroup of G is a virtual
    character. This result, together with the fact that a
    virtual character θ is an irreducible character if and
    only if θ(1) > 0 and {\displaystyle \langle \theta ,\theta
    \rangle =1}￼ (where {\displaystyle \langle ,\rangle }￼
    is the usual inner product on the ring of complex-valued
    class functions) gives a means of constructing irreducible
    characters without explicitly constructing the associated

the morphisms are (equivalence classes of) spans of groupoids.   But it's

2-Vector Spaces and Groupoids
Jeffrey C. Morton
https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2361
There are two major philosophies regarding how to categorify the concept “vector
space”. A Baez-Crans (BC) 2-vector space is a category object in Vect—that is, a
category having a vector space of objects and of morphisms, where source, target,
composition, etc. are linear maps. This is a useful concept for some purposes—it
was developed to give a categorification of Lie algebras. The reader may refer to
the paper of Baez and Crans [3] for more details. However, a BC 2-vector space
turns out to be equivalent to a 2-term chain complex and for many purposes this
is too strict.

    Mackey functors, a concept going back at least as far

    in a suitable category E . The important property of
    the category of spans is that it is compact closed.

What Is “Fundamental”
October 28, 2017 to January 22, 2018
https://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules

    Interesting physical systems can be described in a variety
    of languages. A cell, for example, might be understood
    in terms for example of quantum or classical mechanics,
    of computation, or information processing, of biochemistry,
    of evolution and genetics, or of behavior and function.
    We often consider some of these descriptions “more fundamental”
    than other more “emergent” ones, and many physicists
    pride themselves on pursuing the most fundamental sets
    of rules. But what exactly does it mean?
    
    Are “more fundamental” constituents physically smaller? Not
    always: if inflation is correct, quanta of the inflaton
    field are as large as the observable universe.
    
    Are “less fundamental” things made out of “more fundamental”
    ones? Perhaps – but while a cell is indeed "made of"
    atoms, it is perhaps more so “made of" structural and
    genetic information that is part of a long historical
    and evolutionary process. Is that process more fundamental
    than the cell?
    
    Does a “more fundamental” description uniquely specify a “less
    fundamental” one? Not in many cases: consider string
    theory, with its landscape of 10500 or more low-energy
    limits. And the same laws of statistical mechanics can
    apply to many types of statistically described constituents.
    
    Is “more fundamental” more economical or elegant in terms
    of concepts or entities? Only sometimes: a computational
    description of a circuit may be much more elegant than
    a wavefunction one. And there are hints that even gravity,
    a paragon of elegance, may be revealed as a statistical
    description of something else.



https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/602632/induced-representations


The weakest statement one can make is that for any subgroup
H≤GH≤G and any complex irreducible representation ρρ
of GG, ρρ is a summand of some induced representation
from HH. This follows immediately from Frobenius reciprocity.

But there are much stronger results, which go under the
bracketing name of "induction theorems". Their common
feature is that they say that certain representations
of a finite group GG are obtained as linear combinations
of certain representations induced from certain subgroups.

FINITE SIMPLE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE AS EXPANDERS
ALEXANDER LUBOTZKY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.3411.pdf

A finite k-regular graph X is called
an eta-expander (0<eta) if for every subset
of vertices A of X, with |A|<= 1/2 |X|,
|bdy(A)|>= eta |A| where bdy(A)={y in X|d(y,A)=1}.

Theorem 1.1: there exist k in N, and 0<eta in R,
such that if G is a finite simple group of Lie type,
but not a Suzuki group, then G has a set of k
generators S for which the Cayley graph Cay(G;S) is
an eta expander.

holds for arbitrary non-abelian finite simple group:
"Finite Simple Groups as Expanders"
Martin Kassabov, Alexander Lubotzky, Nikolay Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510562.pdf

Proposition 2. A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 iff there exists 0<alpha
such that for every i, and for every unitary rep V of G_i,
a vector v in V which is “S-almost invariant” is also 
“G-almost invariant”.

Let X=Cay(G;S), k=|S cup S^{-1}| and Delta = 1/k A
where A is adjacency matrix of X.
Then lambda_1(X)=1.

Proposition 3.  A family Cay(G_i, S_i) of Cayley graphs
are eta-expanders for some eta>0 if lambda_2(X_i)<1-delta
for some delta>0 and for all i.
(Note: We do not assume that the sets S_i are of bounded
size. If Si are bounded then the converse is also true.)

Ie. If gapped then eta-expander.

Therefore: if not eta-expander then gapless.

"Universal lattices and property tau"
M. Kassabov and N. Nikolov
https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0502112.pdf
Let G be a discrete group generated by a finite set S. 
Then G has the property tau if there exists 
epsilon > 0 such that for every finite 
irreducible unitary representation
rho : G → U(H) on a Hilbert space H (necessary finite dimensional),
which contains an epsilon-invariant vector is trivial. 
The largest epsilon with this property
is called the tau-constant and is denoted by tau(G; S).
A vector v is called epsilon-invariant 
iff ||rho(s)v - v|| < epsilon ||v|| for all s in S.

Kazhdan property T implies property tau

About the course

The mathematics of expander graphs is studied by three distinct communities:
The algorithmic problem of finding a small balanced cut in a graph (that is, of finding a certificate that a graph is *not* an expander) is a fundamental problem in the area of approximation algorithms, and good algorithms for it have many applications, from doing image segmentation to driving divide-and-conquer procedures.
Explicit constructions of highly expanding graphs have many applications in algorithms, data structures, derandomization and cryptography; many constructions are algebraic, and lead to deep questions in group theory, but certain new constructions are purely combinatorial.
The speed of convergence of MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) algorithms is related to the expansion of certain exponentially big graphs, and so the analysis of such algorithms hinges on the ability to bound the expansion of such graphs.

Hecke's Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_theorem
The first converse theorems were proved by Hamburger
(1921) who characterized the Riemann zeta function by
its functional equation, and by Hecke (1936) who showed
that if a Dirichlet series satisfied a certain functional
equation and some growth conditions then it was the Mellin
transform of a modular form of level 1. Weil (1967) found
an extension to modular forms of higher level, which
was described by Ogg (1969, chapter V).

"Clifford group"
Maris Ozols
http://home.lu.lv/~sd20008/papers/essays/Clifford%20group%20[presentation].pdf

The "real clifford group" on n-qubits is generated by H and CNOT.
This is isomorphic to the finite symplectic group Sp(2n, 2).
|Sp(2n, q)| = q^{m^2}(q^{2m}-1)(q^{2m-2}-1)...(q^2-1)

Including the single qubit P gates:
P = [[1, 0], [0, i]]
we get the Clifford group C_n with 
|C_n| = 4^n |Sp(2n, 2)|

    It is proved that the ring of Siegel modular forms in
    any genus is determined by doubly even self-dual codes
    and the theta relations. The (higher) weight polynomials
    of such codes are proved to be the generators of the
    ring of invariants of a polynomial ring in 2g variables
    under a certain specified finite group. Moreover codes
    are uniquely determined by their weight polynomials.

Atlas of finite groups p. ix
----------------------------

The order of any finite field is a prime power, q=p^f.
These are unique for each q. F_q or GF(q).
F_p = Z/pZ
F_q is constructed from F_p by adding a root of any
irreducible polynomial of degree f over F_p.
It is also equal to the set of solutions of x^q=x in the
algebraic closure of F_p.

The additive group structure of \Complex^g is induced onto J(\Sigma_g)

    There are different kinds of equality. Let us say that
    equality is "intensional" if it distinguishes objects
    based on how they are defined, and "extensional" if it
    distinguishes objects based on their "extension" or "observable
    behavior". 
    
    To use Russell's example, intensionally the morning star
    and the evening star are clearly not the same (because
    their definitions are different), but they are extensionally
    the same because they both denote the same object (planet
    Venus). A more mathematical example is comparison of
    x+yx+y and y+xy+x. These are extensionally equal, but
    intensionally differ because (the usual) definition of
    ++ treats its arguments asymmetrically. It should be
    clear that two functions may be extensionally equal (have
    same behavior) even though they differ intensionally
    (have different definitions).
    
    It is possible for two kinds of equality to coexist. Thus
    in type theory there are two equalities. The intensional
    one is called "judgmental" or "definitional equality"
    ≡≡ and the extensional one is known as "propositional
    equality" ==. Mathematicians are aware of == as a "real
    thing" while they think of ≡≡ as "formal manipulation
    of symbolic expressions" or some such.
    
    We may control the two kinds of equality and the relationship
    between them with additional axioms. For instance, the
    reflection rule collapses ≡≡ and == by allowing us to
    conclude a≡ba≡b from a=ba=b (the other direction is automatic).
    There are also varying degrees of extensionality of ==.
    Without any extra axioms, == is already somewhat extensional.
    For instance, we can prove commutativity of ++ on natural
    numbers by induction in the form x+y=y+xx+y=y+x, but
    we cannot prove x+y≡y+xx+y≡y+x. Function extensionality
    is an axiom which describes what constitutes an "observation"
    on functions: by saying that two functions are equal
    when they give equal values we are in essence saying
    that only values matter (but not for example the "running
    time" or some other aspect of evaluation). Another axiom
    which makes == "more extensional" is the Univalence axiom.

The spectrum of a graph is the spectrum of its adjacency matrix.
J. H. Smith proved the following theorem.
    Theorem
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue strictly less than
        2 are precisely the ADE diagrams.
    *) The connected graphs with greatest eigenvalue equal to 2 are
        precisely the extended ADE diagrams.
Although this theorem was proved in 1969, it is in some sense
implicit in the classification of simple Lie algebras over C.

My student Mike Stay did computer science before he came
to UCR. When he was applying, he mentioned a result he
helped prove, which relates Goedel's theorem to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle:
    C. S. Calude and M. A. Stay, From Heisenberg to Goedel
    via Chaitin, International Journal of Theoretical Physics,
    44 (2005), 1053-1065. 
Now, this particular combination of topics is classic crackpot
fodder. People think "Gee, uncertainty sounds like incompleteness,
they're both limitations on knowledge - they must be
related!" and go off the deep end. So I got pretty suspicious
until I read his paper and saw it was CORRECT... at which
point I definitely wanted him around! The connection
they establish is not as precise as I'd like, but it's solid math.

From HN:
Money as a medium, from McLuhan's Understanding Media, as an encouragement to think of cryptocurrency as a medial paradigm shift...
“Money talks” because money is a metaphor, a transfer,
and a bridge. Like words and language, money is a storehouse
of communally achieved work, skill, and experience. Money,
however, is also a specialist technology like writing;
and as writing intensifies the visual aspect of speech
and order, and as the clock visually separates time from
space, so money separates work from the other social
functions. Even today money is a language for translating
the work of the farmer into the work of the barber, doctor,
engineer, or plumber. As a vast social metaphor, bridge,
or translator, money—like writing—speeds up exchange
and tightens the bonds of interdependence in any community.
It gives great spatial expansion and control to political
organizations, just as writing does, or the calendar.

Domain theory
-------------

"Domain Theory" Samson Abramsky and Achim Jung
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.353.463&rep=rep1&type=pdf

A *pointed* poset is a poset with a bottom: _|_ .

Definition 2.1.8. Let P be a poset. A subset A of P is directed, if it is nonempty and
each pair of elements of A has an upper bound in A.

Eg. chains (totally ordered non-empty subsets)
Eg. finite subsets of a set.

Definition 2.1.13. A poset D in which every directed subset has a supremum we call a
directed-complete partial order, or dcpo for short


Eg. The points of a locale form a dcpo in the specialization order, see [Vic89, Joh82].

Proposition 2.1.15. A partially ordered set D is a dcpo if and only if each chain in D
has a supremum. (uses axiom of choice)

Proposition 2.1.16. A pointed poset P is a dcpo if and only if every monotone map
on P has a least fixpoint.

Definition 2.1.17. Let D and E be dcpo’s. A function f : D → E is (Scott-) continuous
if it is monotone and if for each directed subset A of D we have f(↑A) = ↑f(A).
We denote the set of all continuous functions from D to E, ordered pointwise, by [D −→ E].

Proposition 2.1.18. Let D and E be dcpo’s. Then [D −→ E] is again a dcpo. Directed
suprema in [D −→ E] are calculated pointwise.


Definition 3.1.15. Let D and E be dcpo’s and let e: D → E and p: E → D be
continuous functions. We say that (e, p) is a continuous embedding projection pair (or
e-p-pair) if p ◦ e = idD and e ◦ p ⊑ idE.

Either of e or p determines the other.

Proposition 3.2.2. The cartesian product of dcpo’s is a dcpo. Suprema and infima are
calculated coordinatewise.

3.2.2 continuous functions on DCPO's:
    apply : [D −→ E] × D → E, <f, x> |-> f(x).
    curry : [D × E −→ F] -> [D −→ [E −→ F]].
    composition : [D −→ E]×[E −→ F] to [D −→ F]

Therefore DCPO is cartesian closed.

Definition 3.3.6
    A diagram { (D_n), e_mn : D_n -> D_m with n<=m } is an 
    *expanding sequence* if:
    1. each e_mn is an embedding (the associated projection is called p_nm.)
    2. e_nn = id
    3. e_kn = e_km o e_mn

Theorem 3.3.7
    limit (equals colimit) of expanding sequence {D_n, p_nm} ( {D_n, e_mn} ). 
    Call this the bilimit of D_n.


4. Cartesian closed categories of domains

5. Recursive domain equations

5.2 Construction of solutions

I is the one-point dcpo as discussed in Section 3.2.1
Let D stand for any category of pointed domains, closed under bilimits.

Solve:
    X ~= F(X)

Take (bi-)limit of the sequence I, F(I), F(F(I)), ...

Main Lemma 5.2.2.
Let F be a continuous functor on D^e (subcategory of D with embeddings only).
For each embedding e:A->F(A) consider the colimit <D, e_n> of the
expanding sequence 

   e       F(e)          F(F(e))
A --> F(A) ----> F(F(A)) -------> ...

Then D is isomorphic to F(D) via the maps

fold    = lim_n e_{n+1} o F(e_n)^*  :  F(D) -> D
unfold  = lim_n F(e_n) o e_{n+1}^*  :  D -> F(D)

(where f^* is the upper adjoint of f).

Also:
    F(e_n)  = unfold o e_{n+1}
    F(e_n)* = e_{n+1}^* o fold.


Starting with the initial embedding e:I->F(I) gives
the *canonical* solution to X~=F(X).



p-adic numbers
--------------

Let p be a prime number.
Z_p is the inverse limit of the finite rings Z/p^kZ
It has no zero divisors, so we can form the field of
fractions, denoted as Q_p, the field of p-adic numbers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number

Semantic domains & p-adic numbers?
Fail: Eg. no hom from GF(4)->GF(2).
GF(4) = Z/2Z[X]/(X^2+X+1) = {0, 1, X, X+1}.
No hom because GF has no solution to X^2+X+1.

We show, in great detail, how the perturbative tools
of quantum field theory allow one to rigorously obtain:
a ``categorified'' Faa di Bruno type formula for multiple
composition, an explicit formula for reversion and a
proof of Lagrange-Good inversion, all in the setting
of multivariable power series. We took great pains to
offer a self-contained presentation that, we hope, will
provide any mathematician who wishes, an easy access
to the wonderland of quantum field theory.

Modular forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modular group SL(2, Z).
A *modular form* of weight k for the modular group is 
    1. holomorphic function f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = (cz+d)^k f(z)
    3. holomorphic as z->i \infty

A *modular function* is
    1. meromorphic f:H->C
    2. f((az+b)/(cz+d)) = f(z)
    3. meromorphic at the cusp (i \infty)

The space of modular forms of weight 2k has
dimension 1 for 2k = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14.
No (non-trivial) modular forms for odd weight.
No (non-trivial) modular forms weight k=2.


??? 
A modular function is a meromorphic function on H^/SL(2, Z),
where H^ includes the cusp i\infty (and all the other cusps..right?).


Eisenstein series for the modular group:

G_{2k}(z) = sum_{m, n \in Z, Z != 0}
    1 / (m + n z)^2k.

Defines a modular form of weight 2k, with k>=2 an integer.
Use weight 2k to get even weight otherwise
sumation cancels out to zero.
Sum does not converge for k==1.

Any modular form can be written as a polynomial in G_4 and G_6.
Specifically, there's a recurrence relation for the G's.

With E_2k = G_2k / (2 zeta(2k) )

we have the fourier series, q=e^{2\pi i z}:

    E_4 = 1 + 240 sum_n ( sigma_3(n) q^n )
    E_6 = 1 - 504 sum_n ( sigma_5(n) q^n )

where sigma_a(n) is the sum of the a'th powers of
the divisors of n.

Lambert series:

    sum_n ( sigma_a(n) q^n ) = sum_n ( n^a q^n / (1-q^n) )
        for |q|<=1 and any a.

A *cusp form* has zero coefficient for the q^0 term.

Ramanujan identities involve differentiating E_2, E_4, and E_6 :

q E_2' = (E_2^2 - E_4)/12
q E_4' = (E_2 E_4 - E_6)/3
q E_6' = (E_2 E_6 - E_4^2)/2.


j-invariant
~~~~~~~~~~~

Klein's j-invariant (or j function)
is the unique modular function $j$ such that:
    j(exp(2\pi i/3)) = 0, and
    j(i) = 1728.

Rational functions of $j$ give all
modular functions.

$j$ is a bijection between isomorphism classes
of elliptic curves (moduli space) and \Complex.

Moonshine
~~~~~~~~~

The q-expansion of $j$:

    j(q) = q^{-1} + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 + ...

the coefficient of q^n
is the dimension of grade-n part of the moonshine module,
the first example being the Griess algebra,
which has dimension 196884.

The monster group was investigated in the 1970s
by mathematicians Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John
G. Thompson; they studied the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by subgroups of SL2(R), particularly, the normalizer
Γ0(p)+ of Γ0(p) in SL(2,R). They found that the Riemann
surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic
plane by Γ0(p)+ has genus zero if and only if p is 2,
3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71.
When Ogg heard about the monster group later on, and
noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of
the size of M, he published a paper offering a bottle
of Jack Daniel's whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact.

Congruence
subgroups Γ0(p), for p prime,
are used for defining genus zero surfaces if p−1 divides 24 

The Monster vertex algebra is conjectured (by Edward Frenkel and
collaborators) to be the unique holomorphic 
vertex operator algebra
with charge 24 and partition function j − 744 (where
j is again the modular invariant).



More generally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automorphic form:
    1. well behaved function f:G->C where G is a lie group
    2. invariant under a discrete subgroup gamma in G,
        up to a factor of automorphy.
    3. conditions on growth at infty

Example: Siegel modular form.

"FINITE DIMENSIONAL HILBERT SPACES ARE COMPLETE FOR
DAGGER COMPACT CLOSED CATEGORIES" PETER SELINGER
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.6972.pdf
Abstract. We show that an equation follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed
categories if and only if it holds in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 2.1:
A well-typed equation between morphisms in the language of dagger
compact closed categories follows from the axioms of dagger compact closed categories if and
only if it holds, up to graph isomorphism, in the graphical language.
(See: http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/dagger.pdf )
6. Generalizations
...the results also hold if one replaces k by the ring of Gaussian integers
k = Z[i].
In elementary terms: if a certain equation fails to hold in dagger compact closed
categories, then one can always find a counterexample in matrices with entries of the form
a+bi, where a, b ∈ Z. Moreover, i = √ −1 
can be replaced by √ d for any non-square integer d

    List of subgroups, assuming one fixed pairs of pants decomposition.
    Order 2: Rotation around the midpoint of a short edge interchanges the adjacent
    black and white hexagons; every white hexagon has a black image. There
    are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 3: Cyclic rotation of one pair of pants into itself; cyclic permutation of
    the other pants. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 6: The two symmetries just given combine to the full isotropy group of
    one pair of pants. The decomposition into hexagons by short edges is not
    determined. There are 28 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: From the construction of the pants we know the cyclic group generated
    by two step translations of a closed geodesic made of short edges. The
    uncolored tiling is preserved. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 4: The 180◦-rotations around the twelve vertices of our pant hexagons
    form a Klein Four-group that preserves the colored tiling. There are 14 of
    these subgroups.
    Order 8: Extend the cyclic translation subgroup of order 4 by the 180◦ rotation
    around the midpoint of one of the translated short edges. This is the isotropy
    group of an eight step closed geodesic. There are 21 of these subgroups.
    Order 12: The full invariance group of the colored tessellation contains in addition
    to the above Klein group the order 3 rotations of each of the pants.
    There are 14 of these subgroups.
    Order 24: All the above combine to the full invariance group of the uncolored
    tiling, abstractly this is the permutation group S4. There are 14 of these
    subgroups.
    Order 7: We know this as the invariance group of one heptagon. There are 8
    of these subgroups.
    Order 21: The invariance group of the tiling by 14 big triangles; no black and
    white triangles are interchanged; the isotropy of one triangle has order 3.
    There are 8 of these subgroups.

Cauchy's theorem : if a prime p divides |G| then there
is a g in G of order p.
Proof: look at ordered p-tuples of group elements
(g_1,..,g_p) such that 
g_1 g2 ... g_p = 1.
There are |G|^{p-1} such tuples, which is a multple of p
when p divides |G|. 
Consider the action of Z/pZ on these p-tuples.
All the orbits of this action have size 1 or p 
(corresponding to the two subgroups of Z/pZ.)
The fixed points of this action are the constant p-tuples, ie g^p=1.
We have at least one fixed point for example when g=1.
Therefore there must be another fixed point.

from Toby Bartels:
https://plus.google.com/110399830759499718267

A (linear) isometry is precisely a linear operator T that satisfies
$T^* T = I$, while a co-isometry is precisely what
satisfies $T T^* = I$; a unitary operator is thus
precisely whatever is both.  Also, an isometry or co-isometry is
unitary iff it is invertible; thus, since an isometry is
necessary injective, a unitary operator is precisely a surjective isometry;
while a co-isometry is necessarily surjective, so a unitary operator
is precisely an injective co-isometry.

Projection onto a closed subspace is not just a good
example of a co-isometry but in some ways the canonical
example.  To be specific, if T: H -> K is
a co-isometry, then there is a unitary transformation U from K
to the closed subspace (ker T)^⊥ of H, and U
T is projection onto that subspace.  (U itself can be described
by saying that U* is the inclusion of (ker T)^⊥
followed by T, or equivalently that U* is the restriction
of T to (ker T)^⊥.)  Similarly, the canonical example of
an isometry is inclusion of a subspace; if T: H
-> K is an isometry, then there is a unitary
transformation U from H to the subspace im T of
K, and T U* is the inclusion map of this
subspace.  (U itself is T followed by projection onto im
T, or equivalently T with the codomain restricted to im T.)

ARVIND AYYER, ANNE SCHILLING, BENJAMIN STEINBERG, AND NICOLAS M. THIERY
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4250.pdf

A two-sided ideal of a monoid M is a non-empty subset I
such that MIM \subseteq I.
If I, J are ideals then IJ\subseteq I\cap J and so I\cap J is
non-empty.
Therefore every finite monoid has a unique minimal ideal.

Column monomial matrices are exactly the linear operators
induced by set mappings f:X->X.

Lemma 2.2: Every stochastic matrix is a convex combination of column
monomial matrices.

(This is very far from unique!)

Therefore:

Theorem 2.3. Every finite state Markov chain has a random mapping
representation.

Lemma 3.3: If M is a monoid whose minimal ideal b0 is a left zero
semigroup and if π is a probability on M with support contained in
b0, then π ∗ P = π for any probability P on M. In particular, π is
idempotent.

If a group G acts transitively on a set X,
and H is the stabilizer of x∈X, then gHg−1 is
the stabilizer of gx. Thus a normal subgroup has the
property that it leaves one x∈X invariant, then it leaves
every x∈X invariant.

The normalizer of H in G is the stabilizer subgroup of the conjugation
action of G on the set of conjugates of H.

Say your graph has nn nodes. Start out with nn identical 2-sided dice. Each having 0 on both sides will work fine.
Pick an arbitrary edge in the graph, specifying that DaDa should beat DbDb. All the dice currently have kk sides, and satisfy the requirements for previously added edges, and unconnected dice are even*. Find mm, the maximum of all the faces on the dice. To DaDa, add two faces with m+3m+3. To DbDb, add two faces of m+2m+2. To all other dice, add two faces, one of m+1m+1 and one of m+4m+4. Repeat this procedure for all edges in the graph, winding up with 2e+22e+2-sided dice.

When two systems, of which we know the states by
their respective representatives, enter into temporary physical interaction due to
known forces between them, and when after a time of
mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no
longer be described in the same way as before, viz.
by endowing each of them with a representative of its
own. I would not call that one but rather the
characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its
entire departure from classical lines of thought.

    a vector space to any closed (n-1)-dimensional manifold
    a 2-vector space to any closed (n-2)-dimensional manifold
    ...
    an n-vector space assigned to the point.
Also:
    manifolds with boundary corresponds to (higher) linear operators 
    between these (higher) vector spaces.

The cobordism hypothesis states that this entire structure is contained in
the assignment of the n-vector space to the point.

> the word “decoration” has a near-precise technical meaning in kleinian geometry

this perhaps deserves it's own blog posting, but I am
very curious as to how this works. From what I
can see, there are two (dual) ways of decorating an
object X. One way involves functions *out of* X (colouring
X) and the other way involves functions *into* X (choosing a sub-part of X.)

The Ring of Invariants
----------------------


The ring of symmetric polynomials is finitely
generated (by the elementary symmetric polynomials.)
This ring can be defined as the ring of polynomials
f(x1,...,xn) such that f(p(x)_1,...,p(x)_n) = f(x1,..,xn)
where p is a permutation matrix  (acting on the variables
as basis elements of an n dimensional vector space.)

Generalizing this idea, we can define a ring of polynomials
f^G for any subgroup G of GL(n) as those polynomials fixed
by every element of G.

Questions:
    1. Find a set of generators of f^G. These are the "fundamental invariants."
    2. The relations among the fundamental invariants are called "syzygies."
    3. Write an arbitrary invariant as a polynomial in the fundamental invariants.
    4. Relate geometric properties with invariants and vice-versa.

Complex Reflection group
------------------------

A complex reflection (or pseudoreflection)
of a finite-dimensional complex vector
space V is an element of GL(V) of finite order that fixes
a complex hyperplane pointwise.
A subgroup of GL(V) generated by complex reflections is
a complex reflection group.

All real reflection groups are also complex reflection groups.

The irreducible complex reflection groups were classified
by G. C. Shephard and J. A. Todd (1954). They
found an infinite family G(m,p,n) depending on 3 positive integer
parameters (with p dividing m), and 34 exceptional cases.

Shephard and Todd proved that a finite group acting on 
a complex vector space is a complex reflection group 
if and only if its ring of invariants is a polynomial ring 
(Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem).

Truncated Braid Groups
----------------------

Given braid group B_n = <s_1,...,s_n>,
adjoin the relation s_i^k=1, for i=1,..,n.
These are the truncated braid groups B_n(k)

These groups are finite when 1/n + 1/k > 1/2,
for n>2 this corresponds to the five platonic solids.
In this case the order of the group is |1/2 V|^{n-1} n!
where V is the number of vertices of the platonic solid.

When 1/n + 1/k = 1/2 we get a tiling of the complex plane,
and when 1/n + 1/k < 1/2 it's the hyperbolic plane tiled
by regular n-gons with k polygons around each vertex.

These turn out to be complex reflection groups,
with complex reflections given by the s_i.

For algebraic proof of this:
"Factor groups of the braid group" Coxeter, 1957

"""
so the first point i want to emphasize here is that from everything
i've heard about the langlands program, it's supposed to be very
ambitious; thus for example somewhere in the above discussion someone
quotes the following statement from the paper "an elementary
introduction to the langlands program" by stephen gelbart:

"Herein lies the agony as well as the ecstasy of Langlands'
program. To merely state the conjectures requires much of the
machinery of class field theory, the structure theory of algebraic
groups, the representation theory of real and p-adic groups, and (at
least) the language of algebraic geometry. In other words, though the
promised rewards are great, the initiation process is forbidding."

we can turn gelbart's description here into a very rough superficial outline
of what we'd be working on:

1.  the galois-theoretic aspect of number theory (this is roughly what
gelbart means by so-called "class field theory").

2.  lots of kinds of group theory, including especially the study of
group representations of lots of kinds, but from a very
conceptual-geometric viewpoint.

3.  algebraic geometry, but from a very conceptual and
category-theoretic viewpoint unifying algebraic geometry with group
theory and kleinian geometry and mathematical logic.

4.  combining 1, 2, and 3 into the langlands program.

In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to
be more brilliant than I have gone on to become
distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty
five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve
done all things, often beautiful things in a context that
was already set out before them, which they had no
inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained
prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the
universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To
have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in
themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was
mine: The capacity to be alone.

As most of you probably know, the arXiv recently updated
its TeX engine to TexLive2016, and now expects the .bbl
file holding your references to be generated by biblatex in version 2.8.
Unfortunately the biblatex people (or whoever's responsible for that) keep
changing the format of the .bbl file. If you try
to upload an article to the arXiv and get one
of the following errors 'Package keyval Error: family_i undefined.' or 
'Package keyval Error: given_i undefined.',
it might be that you're using an older (and now incompatible) version of biblatex such
as 2.7 (which is e.g. the current version in an
up-to-date ubuntu distribution). A simple fix is to do a
search and replace in your .bbl file, changing every instance
of 'family_i' and 'given_i' to 'familyi' and 'giveni', respectively.
It cost me a good portion of my evening yesterday to
figure that out, so I thought I'd share this here
in case it saves someone some time and nerves.

    and the solution path making the group solvable and thus making the
    quartic formula possible is: b,j,k,e,a.  (that is, each step amounts
    to a color-wheel decoration against the background of the accumulated
    previous decorations.)

From https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Klein+geometry :

"""
Then in (Klein 1872, end of section 5) it says:

    Suppose in space some group or other, the principal group
    for instance, be given. Let us then select a single
    configuration, say a point, or a straight line, or even
    an ellipsoid, etc., and apply to it all the transformations
    of the principal group. We thus obtain an infinite manifoldness
    with a number of dimensions in general equal to the
    number of arbitrary parameters contained in the group, but reducing
    in special cases, namely, when the configuration originally selected has
    the property of being transformed into itself by an infinite
    number of the transformations of the group. Every manifoldness generated
    in this way may be called, with reference to the generating group, a body.

This means in modern language, that if G is
the given group acting on a given space X,
and if S↪X is a given subspace
(a configuration), then the “body” generated by this is the
coset G/StabG(S) of G by the stabilizer subgroup
StabG(X) of that configuration. See also there at Stabilizer
of shapes – Klein geometry.

The text goes on to argue that spaces of this
form G/Stab_G(S) are of fundamental importance:

    If now we desire to base our investigations upon the
    group, selecting at the same time certain definite configurations as
    space-elements, and if we wish to represent uniformly things which
    are of like characteristics, we must evidently choose our space-elements
    in such a way that their manifoldness either is itself
    a body or can be decomposed into bodies.

I've been going through some math books that I bought many years ago and
now I find that I can start to make sense out of their contents.

In particular, John Conway's book "The sensual quadratic form" (1997). In the
first chapter he characterizes integer binary quadratic forms. It looks
to me like he is using an infinite Coxeter group to do this, because
the geometry involved looks like a polygon whose edges form an infinite tree.

It seems the group underlying this is PGL(2, Z), which is the symmetry group of
the two dimensional Z-module (aka lattice.)

Another good book, and full of examples, is "Classical Invariant Theory" by
Peter J. Olver (1999). He seems to be playing much the same game, but this time
over the real or complex field. I'm guessing that this material is the genesis
of algebraic geometry.

Anyway, I'm noticing how these examples are "contravariant" whereas
(so far) the geometric examples of group actions are "covariant". 
By this I mean, in geometric representation theory 
we have been looking at what objects
stay invariant under a group action, whereas in the algebra examples above
the polynomials *do* change under the group action, but we declare that
these are all equivalent polynomials, and then go on to characterize
this equivalence.

These two styles of using group theory really are duals of each other
in the category theory sense of "dual".

Another example of what I'm calling a covariant 
theory is the theory of symmetric functions: these are polynomials
that are *fixed* by a group. I've also been reading a bit about how
this theory is generalized to the other Coxeter groups.
This is explained in chapter 3 of James Humphreys book 
"Reflection Groups And Coxeter Groups", 1990.



Ah! One other very important example of what I am calling a 
"contravariant" theory is the ADE classification of 
simple singularities of a complex analytic function, due to V.I. Arnold.
This I understand very little of, but am quite interested as it relates
to braids and weyl groups and much more.
